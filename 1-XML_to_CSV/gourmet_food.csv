The smell when you opened the bag was not pleasant, but if you wash them off and parboil, that goes away, but is replaced with a slightly sweet smell that I disliked almost as much.

But I kept an open mind, cooked the noodles for a few minutes, added my favorite sauce and fresh ground pepper with some soy cheese grated on top.  Whoever said it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target, they are incredibly chewy and just don't taste that great either.

The honest truth is that Tazo really does not make many, if any really good teas.  This, in particular, is one of their worst.  It is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately.

Every time i get stuck in a starbucks with friends i am faced with the choice - tea, chai or steamed milk.  Every time i cave in and give Tazo another chance it disappoints me.  If you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop and let them brew you a few cups.  Try a keemun, a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong and see how it goes.  If you really want to kick it up a notch look for a 
Cameroonian black.

take it from someone who really loves tea, this stuff is not worth your time.  and when you get good tea, please don't brew it in your coffee maker"

Harry,California,"Personally, I didn't like Tazo's Red Bush Tea very much.  I've had three different kinds of roiboos teas so far and this was my least favorite.  It seems like the flavor of roiboos itself is pretty mild, and in the case of Tazo's tea, the flavors they add completely overwhelm it.  I found that I had to remove the tea bag very quickly lest the cup become overwhelmingly lemony and acidic.  Perhaps other pallettes will appreciate the strength of those flavors.  Personally, I couldn't wait to finish off the box so that I could find a better flavor.

The other roiboos teas I have tried have had a milder mix of flavors, to a much better overall effect.  My personal choice right now is Trader Joe's Orange Spice Roiboos, which apparently can be bought in some, but not all of their stores.  The orange flavor is much less up front than the lemon & citrus flavors in the tazo tea, and the overall effect of the other spices is very nice.  The tea smells a lot like other spiced foods (pumpkin pie comes to mind) and is very nice on a gloomy afternoon.  Also unlike the Tazo version, the flavor of this tea gets nicer and richer the longer you let the tea bag steep, although even just pouring the water over the bag and leaving it for a few seconds is usually enough for a nice cup.  Admittedly, there are a lot of other roiboos teas I have not tried, but this one has been a hit with me because of its good flavor and local availability.

Keep in mind this is not the opinion of a tea expert, and I have never had roiboos tea in Africa so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like in its authentic presentation.  Just my personal taste"

Beware the sweet seduction of the Milk!  Ah - the bittersweet memories of that first gallon.  How smooth, how creamy, how exhilarating, uplifting, fulfilling and enlightening!  How free it made me feel!  But then came that terrible moment when in my home town supermarket, I reached for a gallon of store brand milk, and felt the pain.  Oh, the pain the Milk can give!

Beware!  Do not let this be your fate!

"B0002TA77A:first_excited,_then_disappointed....:lb",B0002TA77A,"Dark Roast 100% Kona Coffee Pods - Two-Cup style brews 48 cups - For Senseo, Home Cafe, Bunn: Gourmet Food",gourmet food,10 of 10,2.0,"First excited, then disappointed....","January 20, 2005",LB,"Manchester, MO USA","I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.  

After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  It just didn't make sense.  Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.  

My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo.  The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  I always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough.  He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine. 

The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away.  So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.  

Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods.  The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out.  The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried.  So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  But, that has not worked for me.  

So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands.  So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work. 

I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod.  It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  It might be the next thing I try."

I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.

However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether. 

The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).

The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes. 

Live and learn, I guess."

I have bought 2-3 varieties of Tasty Bite from my local Trader Joes.  Most are decently healthy and all are easy and fast to make.

Peas and paneer, as an entree, is bland and without any heat/spice.  I am a native Indian so I can handle relatively spicy food.  However, this entree does not merit even a 2-chili rating (out of four).  

As for food quality, I would suggest microwaving the rice and entree separately.  Otherwise, the majority of the sauce seeps into the rice giving it a very unpleasant appearance.  If you boil the pouches (an alternate option), you may have even more success.  However, most of us buy these because of the ease of preparation, so boiling isn't a convenient option.  The rice tastes and looks as it should.

Finally, I do recommend Tasty Bite Entre, Jaipur Vegetables.  I am on box nine of twelve and still not tired.  This entree is MUCH spicier - closer to a 3.25 chili rating (out of four).  I also favor this entree because it doesn't have the throw-away plastic container in each box.  Moreover, you get 12-boxes for a better price than the 6-boxes for the peas and paneer.

I look forward to trying the other Tasty Bites, though I will likely sample the flavors at Trader Joe's before ordering another 6- or 12-box set.  No more Tasty Bite purchases from the Gold Box unless I have already tried that particular flavor - lesson learned"

Would you believe that in 0.5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate!?  No way!!

The sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate, but since it's 600x as sweet as sugar, they need to bulk it up to make it measure like sugar. But all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates.

This could really screw up somebody on Atkins' Induction phase.  For example, the day before I learned this, I made some Kool-Aid with Splenda.  I didn't know that in 2 quarts I was drinking down 24 carbs!

What to do?  Find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose.  They use water as the filler, it's super-concentrated still, and it truly has 0 carbs.  I look forward to the day when McNeil Nutritionals meets the demand for ZERO-carb Splenda.  (That's 0.0g, not 0.49g!"

I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.

At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.

During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their ""Gold Bears"" are the best.

When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.

I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.

If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed"

They work well in a number of different recipes, are filling, and add a ""calcium boost"" to the dishes I use them in, for very few calories.  These are not ""pasta"" type noodles, of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of ""slippery""), and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them.  I probably won't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas, which these are not.  On the other hand, these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai, Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes (basically, noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce).  There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet which are fairly easy to make, taste terrific, and work beautifully with these noodles.  You can prepare yourself a real treat, if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture, and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice.  In short, if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles, you're likely to be disappointed, but if you use them in Pad Thai, any type of curry, other Asian dishes, or most soups, you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal, low-carb meal. 

One thing - when you open the bag, there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me, anyway).  If you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes, as per the package directions, the odor really does disappear.  It is not a strong odor, it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that, but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them.  Just follow the package directions"

It's great in a wet, soupy type dish. Eaten ""as is"" (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender, too soft to pass for a dry Italian type pasta, unless you always cook dry pasta to death. Boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat, but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta.

For the reviewer who said that pasta is out due to his/her type 2 diabetes... it's not! I'm in the same boat, and we can still enjoy pasta, we just need to measure it to control the carb servings and always use whole grain types to slow down the sugar load. I weigh out 2 oz. before cooking for 2 carb exchanges (the 1/2 cup serving measurement is absurd because different types of pasta will fill a cup differently), and I use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables and have a big salad on the side.The oil and vinegar salad dressing helps to further temper the blood sugar rush. Of course, if you eat lots of carbs for breakfast and lunch, don't plan on 2 carb servings of pasta for dinner. And I have given up the (white) Italian bread on the side! That's the worst part, but the pasta is at least do-able."

The noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta.  But like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use.  I really did like them.  Being diabetic, it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar.  And I didn't find a unpleasant smell when I opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. Just the same I did rinse them well.

I have since found them in a local health food store so I won't have to pay the high shipping any more.  I have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere, only the flat noodle type and I would really like to try the spaghetti.  

I would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb, lower calorie pasta"

However, I still give this 5 stars, because it's got features you can't get anywhere else. The texture is smooth pudding (Grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past the expiration date?) and that's mainly how I use this. Because of the slightly sharp taste of the cellulose, this dip lends itself very well to making citrus puddings (just add about 1/4 cup lemon concentrate and stir, doesn't get any easier than that). I also use it to make cheesecake and other dessert recipes. 

To actually make a good fruit dip out of this, try mixing it with yogurt or cream cheese"

Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:
AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter
CALM:  nice chamomile tea
CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine
CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no ""natural flavorings""
DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine
EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience 
LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's
PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious
WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps
ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea

Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.

Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only ""real"" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.

I use 16 ounces of water and two tea bags for each experience. When you drink these teas you can transcend reality for moments at a time and that is all the truth I need about these teas. Some of these teas even evoke a sense of wonder. 

Warning: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE TEAS. Once you taste these teas, you will want to try them all and forever be on a search for new Tazo teas. Fortunately they have enough tea blends to entertain you for years.

Many people who don't like tea, love it. It is very fragrant and is great hot or iced. If you are used to drinking black tea with no flavor or sweetener you may prefer to blend it with a plain black tea as it is a very strongly flavored tea. Taste it before sweetening it. 

You should buy it in small quantities because it contains no preservatives and the citrus oils can go ""off"" after six months or so. You should also make sure not to store it or serve it in plastic or styrofoam as the citrus oils react with them."

The flavors are spicey, pungent, smack you up side the head intense.  If you like Lipton, you won't like this.  We use the loose tea only.  Yes, it's a little more of a hassle compared to tea bags, but worth it due to the freshness, flavor, etc.

Also, until the our last purchase, which was from Amazon, we always ordered from MarketSpice themselves.  They're great people, they always shipped what I wanted, etc.  I'll never buy from them directly again.  They don't want to move into the 21st Century when it concerns automation and I respect that.

It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.  

As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime.  Almost like a couple of hours on the beach.

I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine.

Martin Jr. ""d_p_m_j""","Concord, NH","Try something different.  Forget microwave popcorn for a few weeks and try this four-pack just once.  At the very least, you'll have a new food experience, but what you might get is a new family tradition.  It's worth it.

My wife and I received a four-pack of Fireworks Popcorn last year with these four flavors, and because we are huge fans of stovetop-popping popcorn, it was a definite treat.  We love watching movies, and it's a weekend tradition to make a giant tub of popcorn and jump on the couch.

This 4-pack is a fantastic way to discover the differences in types of popcorn, and there really are subtle differences.  There is a description of the flavor on each bottle, and the bottles also tell you about the size and robustness of the finished product.  

As gourmet as any other gourmet popcorn I've ever tried, the kernels pop up nice and big and almost every kernel pops.  The flavors augment a good low-fat butter spray if that's your fancy.  I'm very much looking forward to receiving the 8-flavor sampler!

Personally, I pop mine in olive oil with a few dashes of garlic-infused oil and/or the red spicy olive oil and a little salt.  That is something you can't do in a microwave!  If you've never popped popcorn on a stove before and you're intimidated... no worries.  Pour in enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pot, add enough olive oil cover up about half the height of the kernels, shake it over the heat until the popping almost stops, and pour out the popcorn into a bowl asap.  Practice makes perfect, and you don't need much practice at all... maybe just one try!

Honestly, for the labor of about 90 seconds on the stove and one pot to wash, you turn an evening of TV-viewing or movie watching into an event.  The kids will love it, and as a grown-up kid, I highly recommend it.  I have fond memories of my dad making popcorn for the three kids on Saturday nights, and this is a good product to make those memories"

Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are as the box states ""the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India."" They provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. The fragrance is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. A tasty sensual delight!

Earl Grey is traditionally served black, sometimes with lemon. I prefer it with cream. On a warning note, if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh. Brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed"

As it happens I am in very good company in this practice along with the likes of Captain Picard and the eponymous Earl Charles Grey himself. Earl Grey is one of the more popular and well-known kinds of tea in the world and deservedly so. Despite general belief, Earl Grey is not a tea varietal at all, but simply ordinary black tea infused with bergamot, a citrus flavor from the rind of the fruit. Try your cup with a few drops of fresh lemon juice for some occasional, yet delicious, variety. It is also pretty neat to watch the lemon juice lighten the tea from dark brown to yellow as the citric acid reacts with the blend!

The Tazo version of Earl Grey is one of the best I have ever tasted. Perfectly balanced, light, aromatic.....it's the perfect start to a morning"

First off, they are the best after dinner snacks out there. It's really like a cake, just more condensed and not as fatty or filling. Also, these things are addicting. In my life, I cannot even count how much packs I have consumed, since I have been eating these things everyday since I was young, and let's just say now I am very old. If you cannot afford drugs, then go for the ring-ding's. The only negative about these things if there isn't enough cream, then you get a mouthful of chocolate. Most people I know like the chocolate, but I personally would not like a mouthful of it. Another bad thing is in the summer, they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated. They kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer, which makes this the perfect snack for the winter.

Alright...the anatomy of a ring-ding (DUN-DUN-DUN). First off, you get a chocolatey outside that is pretty soft. In the center is a creamy sensation (sorry if that sounded dirty...get your mind out of the gutter) that really makes this product go from good to great. Put that together and you get probably the best snack out there right now. They come two in a pack and are made by Drake's. Usually, Drake's is in the shadow of Hostess, yet I feel Drake's destroys Hostess in terms of their cakes. If you are actually reading this, please don't destroy me for saying that Ring-Ding's totally annihilates anything Hostess has ever put out. Wow...I managed to make a food product two paragraphs long (two short paragraphs I should say). I would put the whole history of the Ring-Ding in, but that would probably be taking someone else's work. I guess I'll stop now. Anyway, Ring-Ding's for the win!!"

In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea. 

Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe. 

You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste .."

Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as ""cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice"" and ""medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.


The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.

I am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee!

There is a downside to this coffee maker: it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to, and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently. The first time I tried to use mine, I had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever! The big time consumers: you have to boil your water separately (you do have a water kettle right?) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the Chemex. This means that while the coffee is brewing, you are pouring, or watching, or giving the filter area a bit of a stir.

Now the up side: you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee. I use filtered water, freshly ground home roasted beans, and this Chemex to produce the finest coffee I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. And this coffee is a pleasure! In fact, I've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide.

Another up side: clean up means swishing the Chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain. You can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary. A brief swish is really all it takes to get your Chemex looking factory new. Try that with your electric drip machine! Ha! That thing will NEVER look brand new!

Oh, here's a final upside: this Chemex brews the best coffee you'll ever drink, and it costs less than just about anything. You are probably already spending more money than this every month at Starbucks!

Go ahead and buy yourself one of these. If necessary, wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee. Better yet, wake up 20 minutes earlier. And when your coffee is ready, instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door, sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes. You deserve it"

I'm not going to say that I've tasted many Earl Grey teas, because the only other Earl Grey Tea I've tasted is Twinings. But this tea in my opinion added a twist that was needed for Earl Grey Tea. Don't get me wrong Earl Grey Tea is fine the way it is, but the scented citrus bergamot added by Tazo makes a difference. 

I would enjoy drinking the Tea straight up with some sugar, but I like to add a little bit of milk to the tea because I'm used to adding Milk to Black Teas.

Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot.  Earl Grey tea has an interesting history.  Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men.  Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are as the box states ""the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India."" They provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. The fragrance is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. A tasty sensual delight!

Earl Grey is traditionally served black, sometimes with lemon.  I prefer it with cream.  On a warning note, if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh.  Brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed"

A teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible, and I like very hot and spicy foods.  Five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish.  Tabasco isn't even comparable to this, because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot.  This is truly the hotest sauce I have ever had, I think it killed my tastebuds (slight sarcasm).

Wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid.  If you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time, and I would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience.

These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. 

When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress. 

The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites. 

Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection: 

Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache 

Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate. 

Irrsistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce. 

For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate. 

Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache. 

Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling. 

Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache. 

Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache. 

Posie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling. 

Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling. 

Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling. 

Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream. 

Also Recommended: 

If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. 

Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. 

My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.

Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent ""natural flavors"" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!

The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these ""natural flavors"" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor."" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as ""grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""vegetative, popcorn"". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.

Tazo's Lotus Decaffeinated Green Tea is one of my favorite Tazo teas. The lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. This tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. It is one of the most natural-tasting of the Tazo's I've tasted, very subtle, and much less artificial-tasting.

The ingredients in Lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Of course, this tea is caffeine-free.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as ""peach, nutty, flowery, overripe melon. This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied, with an aroma reminiscent of freesia."" Tazo also describes the aroma as ""tropical fruit, green tea"". Hmmm...I don't taste all of these various flavors, and I suspect that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. I taste green tea, and a nice flowery flavor, which I'm assuming is the lotus, but not the rest---the peach, nuts, melon, freesia, tropical fruit---they're missing from what I can discern here.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars.

I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. 

Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. 

Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. 

I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. 

A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component. 

For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea.

They are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger.  They are Omaha Steaks best product and the only thing I order from them. I actually love the packaging. Each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic, which means I can keep them in the freezer until I am ready to eat them. Then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes I have fresh red meat, they have a nice peppery Angus beef smell, and they taste great. They never go to waste.  I find the meat I buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. Them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. Ok, the Styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging, and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times.

Amazon also has a great price on these. After a quick search around the web, this looks to be the best price"

Now for the goods: These vanilla beans are a fantastic value.  Seriously, I wasn't expecting much- I was hopeful given the other reviews- but I've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items-  These beans are even superior to those I can get from my local provider (at three times the cost, mind you.)  I've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by Martha Stewart, lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers.  (Plump and supple- always a good thing.)

If you're on the fence- I urge you to go for it.  You owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I'm not.

Drinking this particular tea blend almost begs for 32 ounces of water. You can brew this tea in your coffee maker by letting the water drip slowly onto the tea that is sitting in a coffee filter or you can use the infuser that comes with this kit. 

This tea has a magical, almost golden sparkle of brass. The ingredients in this herbal blend are almost romantic. How often do you drink a tea with ""rose petals"" in the blend? 

Ingredients: Chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice, and other natural flavors. 

Chamomile is known for its soothing properties and after drinking this tea I have vivid dreams and my sleep is deep and calm and I wake up refreshed. Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion will allow your body to relax into sleep and can be especially calming after yoga, before bed, or when writing peaceful thoughts in your journal.

Tazo's Decaffeinated Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Decaffeinated Chai as ""creamy, vanilla, sweet and pungent spices"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.


The ingredients in Decaffeinated Chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas, rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, chicory, cloves, black pepper, natural flavors, and star anise. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Decaffeinated Chai gets only four stars.

Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet. 

The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, juicy, red fruits"". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.

This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land. 

Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine. 

The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.

The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed.

 The jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from Oberto or whomever). The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar.
 
 However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well.
 
 As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way.
 
 The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.
 
 Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.
 
 I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.
 
 Definitely recommended"

Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.

It is a ""perfectly"" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean.

Grown in South Africa's Cederburg Mountains and harvested during the summer, this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization, when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green.

Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.

This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices.

The flavor of rooibus is just the base note.  Congratulations to Tazo for their light touch with hibiscus--if this tea is brewed properly--4 minutes max--it is light and refreshing.

Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm.

Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of a fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. 

For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel.

I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. 

An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension. Just drinking the tea seems to improve your skin due to the high antioxidant levels, 50 times that of green tea! 

This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea. I must say that the Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.

It's not as if I can be expected to munch on a wieldy leg of lamb during my morning full body shave. 

But then one day a traveler who I had commanded to bring back the finest exoticities from the farthest ends of our flat disc, came to me with a handful of small round pellets. He called them ""California Red Seedless Grapes"". 

I had him immediately put to death for reciting words I had never heard before, but I was intrigued. And wouldn't you know it, but during my afternoon copulation with two dozen virgins, these grapes were exactly what I needed. I was able to do my usual defiling of whomever I choosed and yet due to the curious vine these pellets hung upon, never once was I unable to calm my disgustingly bloated belly. 

And did I mention the taste? IMHO, It's like a glorious gift from Enlil that both An and Ki have given their blessing to, with the bonus of no seeds. I mean seriously, our Gods are truly seers of all to know that I'm no fan of seeds.

But in conclusion while I still don't know where this ""California"" is, I know that they have a wonderful fruit, and I hope that soon we conquer them. I also hope they have virgins.

Also since I'm already here, you guys heard the one about the three ox-drivers from Adab? You know, where the punchline is ""With elaborate words, with elaborate words, the case of the citizens of Adab was settled. Pa-nijin-jara, their sage, the scholar, the god of Adab, was the scribe.""?

But no--apparently a Corn Lobby Broom wasn't good enough for him. Anyway, he wouldn't talk to me for a month, which was good at first, but then got really annoying.

For my kid's birthday I decided to get him something really special, so I got him this bag of xanthan gum. I even wrapped it up real nice with wrapping paper and ribbon. My kid opened his present and couldn't figure out what it was. ""It's xanthan gum,"" I told him, ""It's gum from outer space. From the planet Xanthan."" My kid was busy staring at the label. ""No it's not,"" he slowly replied, and then he began to read, ""'Xanthan is made from the outer layer of a tiny, inactive bacterium called Xanthomonas campestris..."" ""From the planet Xanthan!"" I interrupted. Since when did my kid learn to read? I grabbed the bag and opened it. ""Here,"" I stuck a spoon into the white powder, ""Try some. It's really good."" My kid picked up the spoon and smelled the white powder. ""Go on,"" I said, ""you'll really like it!"" He hesitated, and then stuck his tongue into the powder. I was starting to get impatient, so I grabbed the spoon from him, ""Give it to me, you big chicken,"" and then I swallowed the powder. The stuff dissolved into a thick, slimy paste in my mouth, but I smiled as I chewed it, ""Mmmmm... this is the tastiest xanthan gum in the whole universe!"" My kid looked at me as if I were lying. ""If you like it so much, then you can have it,"" he said. ""Fine,"" I replied, ""it's too good for you anyway."" I figured a little reverse psychology would do the trick. My kid's expression didn't change. ""Can I go now?"" he asked. ""Yeah, fine, get out here,"" I said.

Brown ""Ms. O. Khannah-Brown""","Twopeas, WA","*****
Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent ""natural flavors"" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!

The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine. Note that this review is for the loose tea leaves (in other words, no tea bags!).

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these ""natural flavors"" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.

On the accompanying information with the product, Tazo writes, ""a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor."" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as ""grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""vegetative, popcorn"". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.

Light Roast, the smooth tasting coffee with the greatest caffein content. Tastes similar to Chock Full o' Nuts coffee.

No amount of water or soap could remove the burning from the oils that were displaced on my nose.  Also don't directly touch it or reach into the bag with acrylic nails.  I ruined a fresh french manicure and learned the hard way - the essential oils leave a green film on your nails that takes days to wear off.

Add blueberries and you have yourself a great breakfest. All other store brand Belgian Waffle mix offered in every store chain pale in comparsion. The person that said this was awful... a few ideas. Heat the water you add for 1 minute in microwave- this makes the dough rise for fluffy waffles-then do the same for the butter you add to the mix ( this adds moisture to the dough) stir in blueberries and everyone here asks for seconds. My husband eats breakfest in Amsterdam six times a month and he has never complained nor made comparisions about these waffles- nothing but excellent taste with a real hint of malt flavoring.
Some math- National Breakfest Chain $7.00 for one Belgian Waffles or 10 waffles for $3.79 plus the cost of the blueberries- how can you beat that! Don't forget the fresh whipped cream"

The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. It is full without being overbearing, it is seasoned without being overpowering. It's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry. 
Since conception, I have been in love with tea, but ""the Prince"" was my first fine tea. I have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity. And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names, it's still my favourite.
Never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it's flavored with spice. Would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? Ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too. 
Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties I've had, this one is the clear winner. I've gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes. The stuff is potent enough that you can get, gasp, a reasonably tannin-free second infusion.
My only reservation is this; once you've entered the universe of fine tea, you can never be satisfied drinking Lipton, Salada, Twinings or Tetley again. In guise of gifts, I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that I may sup of it when I visit. Isn't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is  today preserved by our friends in socialist France? Viva la Revolution!

Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.

The flavor is great!  It smelled ""toastier"" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.

We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the ""old way.""  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.

Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!"

They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.

For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean ""bread"") both are revolting.

I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of ""Joanna"" or ""mtspace"" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast.

Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced.

I only give Marmite four stars.  That probably tells you my upbringing"

But, to my mind, Marmite is far superior.

And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it.  Not everyone reacts to it the same way.  Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease.  Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight  to go bad.  These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim ""Love it or Hate it""  is quite apropos.  It rarely evokes a neutral reaction.

The best preparation I can think of is to mix it thoroughly with butter.  One part Marmite to two or three parts butter.  Then spread thinly on toast.  Served this way, the primary flavor of Marmite is salt.  Then there is a subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it's a flavor that is present in well browned mushrooms or red meat.  The label suggests that it might be put to excellent use in soup stocks as a  substitute or supplement to caramelized roasted vegetables - onions and carrots.

As for nutritional value, even spread thinly it is dynamite.  Those who fall hopelessly for its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses of a few crucial B vitamins.  It is an exceptionally rich source of B12, folicin, and B6.  And since it is free of animal products it is an ideal food to include in a Vegan diet which normally falls short in delivering B12."

Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as ""cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice"" and ""medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.

The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.

These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. 

When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress. 

The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites. 

Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection: 

Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache 

Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate. 

Irrsistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce. 

For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate. 

Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache. 

Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling. 

Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache. 

Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache. 

Posie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling. 

Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling. 

Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling. 

Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream. 

Also Recommended: 

If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. 

Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. 

My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.

A New York Times article convinced me that a Pod system would be the way to go, and i found the Philips Senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level.  Alas, the Douwe Egberts pods that come with are, um, IMHO, not good.

A brief web search led me to Aloha Island's Senseo-style pods, and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods.  The package arrived swiftly, and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts:  nice touch!  i immediately placed a pair in the Senseo unit and let it do its thing.  Wow!  The quality of the coffee is, to date, unparalled.  Rich, smooth, and frothy, almost like a latte before the milk is added.

An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.

You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.

I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:

eggs
potatoes
pizza
anything creole (forget tabasco!)
cottage cheese
most rice
mac cheese
and of course...Mex

Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as ""tart, sweet, smooth, licorice"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""oranges, roses, lime"".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.

I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. 

I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. 

The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. 

Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. 

I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. 

A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component. 

For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea. That was the first Tazo tea I tasted and so far I can't think of a Tazo tea I don't love.

Among Tazo's many blends is Passion, a bold and flavorful mixture of hibiscus flowers, other tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass, and red poppy. Brew it up, and you are rewarded with a bright red infusion, that has a tart and exciting taste.

Now, this tea is definitely not for everyone. As you can tell from the ingredients, this tea is strong and decidedly on the tart side. When drunk hot, you probably will want to sweeten it with honey or moderate it with milk, or possibly both. But, when made into an iced tea, Passion really comes into its own - decidedly refreshing and thirst-quenching. Just what you need for a hot summer day!

So, overall I would say that this is a pretty darn good hot tea, and a great iced tea. Buy some today"

Smoked in Wisconsin over applewood, it is delectable, luscious even.  They cut it lean so that there is no rubbery, fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands, yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor.  It is worth noting that America's Test Kitchen did a Taste Test of Bacon, in which Neuske's was a participant.  It did NOT come out as No.1, because tasters thought it was ""too smoky"".  If you like smoky bacon like I do, that sounds like crazy talk, and you should definitely try this bacon.  The results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky, and I suppose that if you are one of those people, you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever).

Be careful though: once you eat Neuske's and love it, you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again"

My family will have to live with less this batch because my first sample cup quickly turned into 3 big cups!  Yummmmmmmm.

Don't know what some of the other folks here are talking about when they say it smells/tastes bad.  Smells just like some of the better-quality green tea in teabags, but stronger, sweeter and much richer.  Taste is smoother, no bitterness, much fuller, and surprisingly long-lasting.  I'm no tea connoisseur, I just know what I like and this one is awesome.

A little research on the web helped.  The general consensus seems to be that 160-180 degree water is the best, brewed about 2 minutes.  I don't have a thermometer or anything fancy so I brought the water just to boiling and waited 5 minutes before using.  Brewed 2 minutes then poured through a strainer into a pitcher.

If you're willing to go through a bit of extra trouble, you can use the same leaves up to 3 times.  A little goes a long way.  I used about 2 rounded tablespoons, brewed 3 times, and got more than a full pitcher of nice strong tea.  I like my tea strong, and it looks like 2 level tablespoons would still do the job nicely.

The brown-and-lime faux-leather box, a treat for the eyes in itself, contains 15 pieces of what can only be described as Godiva's most ambitious and delicious chocolates to date. The 15-piece G Collection closely mirrors the more expensive ""American Pies"" collection, but provides many unique and otherwise unobtainable pieces that more than justify the cost of the set.

The rich, all-encompassing flavor of the G Collection's fruit pieces is on par with the ""American Pies"" collection: Key Lime and Cherry stand out, bursting from their fragile, sugar-coated shells with an intense and supremely enjoyable tang. A box of this size ought to last - one will quickly find that the richness (to overuse the word) marks these candies as individual luxuries to be enjoyed over time. Simply scarfing these down simply will not to justice to the complex, excellent job Godiva has done in blending different ingredients to make authentic, mouth-watering flavors.

Godiva's G Collection can never be explained satisfactorily until they are tried. Only on the tastebuds can an accurate and deserving review of these milestone candies be written"

As a gift however, this is a great box (there is a similar all heart shaped box for Valentines - which is cool if you dig hearts).  It fits all the qualities I look for in a gift.  Its extravagant, its something the person I give it to will love, and its something they wouldn't get themselves.  I tried 2 of these, the mixed berry is ridiculously good.  The peanut butter and jelly was interesting.  Everything is superb quality wise.  I knock it down a bit on price, but honestly, its tough to find fault in this product.  It much much better than regular Godiva (which I find to be super sweet and overpriced)"

The presentation is stunning, from the packaging to the airbrushed pieces.  And the taste is incredible.  The original flavors gave me pause (peanut butter and jelly?) but they work so, so well and taste better than any chocolate I've ever had.  Each piece averages to $3, but every piece is way better than $3 of candy bars or ice cream.  Most pieces are better than $12 desserts from 5-star restaurants.  So while the price seems extreme, once you taste a piece you will understand that it SO WORTH IT.  A perfect gift for a discerning chocolate lover and for yourself"

Noodles need boiling.,"July 3, 2006",gensparkie,California,"I am a huge fan of Tasty Bite products, and was delighted to find that Amazon now stocks them, since they are expensive in my small town (no Trader Joe's here!). I was excited to see this variety that I had never tried before, and readily ordered the six pack of these noodles with peanut sauce, expecting the same ready-to-eat food that the other Tasty Bites I have tried offer.

But unlike their ready-to-eat rice dishes in which the rice and the packet merely need heating but are already fully cooked, the noodles here are in their raw state and need to be boiled for ten minutes, so you can't grab this and bring it to work the way you can most other Tasty Bite meals.

Also, the peanut sauce has a delectable and complex flavor, but is spiced and textured so that I felt it really needed some vegetables and or meat to round it out. I love spicy dishes, but this meal seemed planned to be overly spiced so that when you add the veggies and meat, it would be perfect.

So, as a quick meal starter at home or as a way of helping to use up leftover meat and veggies, this gets five stars. It was delicious. Some additions I have enjoyed are chicken, steak, bell pepper, cauliflower, carrots, eggplant, and sweet potato. 

But I am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation from eating other Tasty Bite entrees was that this was a grab and go meal that I could pop in the microwave and have prepared in a couple of minutes."

"B0000YE25A:only_the_start_of_your_sushi_making_journey...:rebecca_johnson_""the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com""",B0000YE25A,Sushi Kit II: Gourmet Food,gourmet food,6 of 7,5.0,Only the start of your Sushi making journey...,"March 26, 2006","Rebecca Johnson ""The Rebecca Review, finding beauty in the world - www.SeasonedwithLove.com""",Washington State,"Once you see the book that accompanies this starter kit, you will realize two things. You won't be making sushi anytime soon without a few more items. Not only do you need fresh ingredients, you need things that are listed in the recipes to make Miso, to make Number-one Dashi and Number-two Dashi. You need Bonito flakes and kombu, you need things like bamboo leaves too. OK, so you don't need bamboo leaves, but having a bamboo plant around the house wouldn't hurt. 

The book is especially helpful, but to make the sushi rice professionally, you do need to also order a rice-cooling tub (hangiri). A square omelet pan is needed, but not essential. You can adapt by using a regular pan. 

Just add your fresh ingredients is the understatement of the year. You do get a sushi press, a sushi mat and Nishiki Sushi rice. The sushi Nori is essential as is the ginger, wassabi, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sweet wine (mirin) and white sesame seeds. 

Other items you will want to have on hand when this arrives: 

Chopsticks
Ginger Grater
Chopping Board
Fish Knives (sushi knives)
Plates for serving Sushi (not essential but make it more interesting)
Skewers - for when you cook shrimp
Rice Maker
Stainless Steel Colander
Wooden Rice Paddle - or you can use a wooden spoon

Ingredients: 

Avocados
Cucumber
Carrots
Asparagus
Chives
Eggplant
Daikon Radish
Fresh Shiitake mushrooms
Lotus Root
Kombu
Miso paste
Ocha - tea
Sake
Shiso - an aromatic herb
Snow Peas
Sushi Vinegar called Awasezu
Tofu - various types but Japanese Silken is recommended
Wakame Seaweed


Recommended Seafood selections include: Mackerel, Salmon, Crabs, Blue-Eye Cod, Tuna, Herring, Sea Bass and numerous other selections. I will be making mine with cooked fish for the most part and many of the recipes indicate cooking the shrimp. 

The book gives excellent full-color picture step-by-step instructions for preparing
seafood. Everything from cleaning squid to angled cuts for sahimi. 

Prepare to learn an ancient art form. This is serious cooking with gourmet appeal. There are instructions for making garnishes and dipping sauces. 

The Tuna Rolls are probably going to be one of the first items to make because they have few ingredients and you don't need anything except a rice cooker, sushi vinegar and the rolling mat. The California-roll-style Temaki-zushi also look fairly tame. 

The Nigiri-Zushi made in sushi bars seem a little more complex. To make a simple Inari-Zushi you need tofu and there are extensive instructions for how to make the little packets or pouches for rice. These seem very interesting and I've tasted them before and definitely look forward to trying to make them. 

The idea of a Chirashi-Zushi rice bowl is interesting and does not require a great deal of artistic application. 

So, if you want to make a full sushi meal, it gets a little more complex, but you can try out various recipes and master the ""dashi"" which is like a fish stock/soup made with kombu and bonito flakes. This knowledge is of course needed to make the sushi rice, which leads me right back to needing a hangiri. I suppose you can use a glass bowl instead. 

This sushi kit is truly only a brief start to an artistic journey. Even after ordering this you may find you need a few more items before you can start taking steps in the direction of actually making sushi. 

I will report back as I try various recipes and all I can say is this will require an adventurous spirit and a few more Amazon orders. Once you have the Sushi book, things start to become more clear and you can make a list of things to order.

It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!

1 1/2c milk
2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder
1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)
10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)

Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!"

Tazo's Decaffeinated Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Decaffeinated Chai as ""creamy, vanilla, sweet and pungent spices"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.


The ingredients in Decaffeinated Chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas, rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, chicory, cloves, black pepper, natural flavors, and star anise. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Decaffeinated Chai gets only four stars.

If you like your Chai with a peppery kick, then this tea will interest you. Rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, decaffeinated black tea, cardamom, ginger, chicory, cloves, star anise and other natural flavors seem to take a back seat to the delicious peppery flavor of this tea. This tea tastes similar to a tea I first tasted in Africa, where Rooibos tea is grown. 

Best served with milk/powdered milk/soy milk or a dash of cream and some honey. Since this is a decaffeinated tea, it is perfect for late night writing sessions or when you want something calming to drink that doesn't taste like chamomile.

There are numerous varieties of ramen so you have to try many of them to find those that you think have the best flavor.

We were a bit apprehensive the first time we tried this ramen.  However, it has since become one of our favorites.  The spice is hot, but it adds a really good flavor to the noodles.  A real winner when you are in the mood for spicy food, or on a cold day.  Because this ramen is very hot, we have also mixed a package of this ramen with a package of chicken ramen to lower the chemical heat.  Even with such a mixture the soup is still fairly hot.

When I say hot, I mean spicy hot.  For many people medium hot is incredibly hot, but I can barely discern any spice in medium hot salsa.  I am accustomed to eating spicy Mexican food and Korean food, so when I say this soup is hot, you have a good reference"

Shrimp cocktail not kicking, El Yucateco will show those shrimp who's boss.  I even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat.

Full of yummy MSG.  Do you know how MSG works?  It dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense.  It actually has no taste of its own.  Did you know?

When my mother was pregnant with me, she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos.  I don't know why.  Maybe the salty goodness.

If cheetos cost as much as truffles, they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants.  I wonder if you can buy truffles on Amazon.com.  Shall we check?  See you there"

Violets are very hard to describe. They have a wonderful, perfumed scent that makes you think that they will taste like some sort of chemical, but nothing can be further from the truth. These candies have a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath.

When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Violets (at least that's what I called them). Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the taste of Violets takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy.

So, if you want a candy that tastes like NOTHING you've ever had before, then buy these candies. They are fantastic"

This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. 

Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.

Hoelscher ""debater7""",Texas,"The product description calls the Orangettes ""Belgian Vitamin C.""  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.

I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.

These candies are not hard, and quite chewable for those who prefer that.

I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. 

Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. 

Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. 

I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. 

A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component. 

For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea.

Tazo's Lotus Decaffeinated Green Tea is one of my favorite Tazo teas. The lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. This tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. It is one of the most natural-tasting of the Tazo's I've tasted, very subtle, and much less artificial-tasting.

The ingredients in Lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Of course, this tea is caffeine-free.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as ""peach, nutty, flowery, overripe melon. This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied, with an aroma reminiscent of freesia."" Tazo also describes the aroma as ""tropical fruit, green tea"". Hmmm...I don't taste all of these various flavors, and I suspect that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. I taste green tea, and a nice flowery flavor, which I'm assuming is the lotus, but not the rest---the peach, nuts, melon, freesia, tropical fruit---they're missing from what I can discern here.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars.

Just a very different candy from what we are used to--it doesn't taste overly ""sugary"", won't feel like you are greasing your mouth with fructose, etc...give it a try.  I wish I had bought two boxes.  I wish Amazon offered the Balla-Balla, too.  I can't wait to try that sometime, but I would rather wait until I can get it at a good price.

Today I'm going to review one of my favorite treats: Kraft Jet-Puffed marshmallows! Boy, do these take me back to those misspent days of my foolish youth. I remember those wonderful times when I'd grab a couple bags of these, and play a round or two of ""Fat Rabbit"" with a few of my visiting cousins. Now what is ""Fat Rabbit"" (""Chubby Bunny"" in some locales), you say? It's a campfire game where you and at least one opponent take turns popping marshmallows into your mouth, one at a time (no chewing or swallowing allowed), trying to say the words ""fat rabbit"" after each new marshmallow tossed into your gub. The guy who is still able to pronounce ""fat rabbit"" with the most marshmallows stuffed in his/her cheeks is the winner. 

I usually beat out my less-than-capable opponents back in the day, but my victories came at a high price: my cheeks got stretched out so much, my jowls are now floppier than the ones my grandpa had when he passed away in the convalescent home a few years back. I probably shouldn't have challenged him to that game of ""Fat Rabbit"" during that last visit...

You won't get a better steak in a restaurant, and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house, I could be stabbed just for saying that.

Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm.

Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel. 

I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension. 

This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea. 

The Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.

I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:

eggs
potatoes
pizza

most rice
mac cheese

This model has worked admirably in the 2+ months I've had it, roasting one batch at least every two days.  It's not automatic (there isn't a good roaster that is) and you need to carefuly monitor color, aroma, and ""cracks"" to achieve a consistent roast, but the coffee it produces is balanced, consistent, and far and away better than anything you can buy in the store.

The negatives are that it does feel a mite flimsy:  the glass roasting chamber sits precariously on the fan unit and could easily be knocked off and broken.  Also, it only roasts a few ounces at a time -- perfect if you just want to roast enough for your morning cup, but don't expect to be able to roast half or entire pounds of coffee for gifts.  The smoke is pervasive, so it's helpful to roast the beans under your stovetop exhaust fan, lest you set off the smoke alarm.

Overall, this is an excellent product for the home roaster who's just getting into the world of coffee roasting.  Should the interest take hold a little more, it would be wise to upgrade to a larger capacity table-top drum roaster, or a used commercial machine"

B000GHUD86:about_as_easy_and_effective_as_sprouting_can_be:f._webb,B000GHUD86,Easy Sprout Sprouter: Gourmet Food,gourmet food,13 of 13,5.0,About as easy and effective as sprouting can be,"December 7, 2006",F. Webb,NY United States,"The Easy Sprouter is a great vertical sprouter. The seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes. The inner cup sets in the outer cup which catches any dripping water and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides. Maintaining your growing sprouts (for most seed types) means holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds, allowing excess water to drain off, and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup. Doing this two or three times a day makes sure that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough to avoid spoiling, moist enough not to dry out, but never remaining in standing water. Most seeds need to be pre-soaked initially, and this step can be managed directly in the Easy Sprouter. There are three lids: two lock into place - one with air holes, one without. The third is domed, but doesn't actually lock onto the cup.

By comparison, sprouting in canning jars requires the jar to be filled and emptied several times with each rinsing, and draining sufficiently is not always easy. The Sprout Master, which is another sprouting tray I love, allows similar rinsing, but the seeds must be soaked in a different container and then transfered to the Sprout Master. The Sprout Master allows the growing plants slightly more light because it has width rather than height, but the difference is slight.

I've mostly used my Easy Sprouter for leafy sprout salad mixes (alfalfa, clover, etc...) These varieties take about a week to grow. With the variety of lids the sprouter it is very flexible. I haven't tried to sprout while traveling, but I'm confident that it would work well. It works for storing your grown sprouts in the fridge as advertised, but I usually take them out of the sprouter and break up the clumps before serving and put any left-overs into a different container. I use my Easy Sprouter nearly constantly, along with my Sprout Master mini trays. I currently have a second Easy Sprouter on order"

I get asthma from wheat flour, so I've spent the last 8 years searching for the perfect flour.  I've been using this for years now, I love this stuff.  I use it for cookies, cakes, crepes, pancakes, waffles*, madalines, yorkshire pudding, flouring meats for crispy frying, thickening soups and sauces, etc etc.  The only thing that it hasn't worked for is bisquits.  I think because this flour needs a binding agent, such as eggs or Xantham Gum.  With just the butter the dough after baking falls apart.  flakey and yummy, but a total mess!  
It also tastes kind of bitter raw, but once it's baked or cooked it's exactly the same flavor and texture as wheat flour.  

You can't go wrong with this alternative.  

Go forth confidently and experiment with all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour!  

I love trying Martha Stewart's cookie recipes, this flour works perfectly for all I've tried.

*Some recipes may require a little extra leavening agent (baking soda or baking powder), such as waffles, madalines and pancakes."

It is much more delicate than a Rooibos tea and has a golden rose color. When blended with a clover honey, it almost has a hint of lemon. 

The Honeybush is a plant that only grows in the high mountains of the Western and Eastern Cape regions of South Africa. I might have first tasted this tea when we visited Cape Town and went to Table Mountain. The plant is harvested during the flowering season. 

Honeybush is naturally sweet, caffeine free and has very little tannin. I still enjoy adding honey to this tea to enhance the natural honey flavor. This mineral rich infusion is rather soothing and can help to calm the nervous system. 

This is technically a wild mountain tea with a hint of aromatic flowers. I only wish I was drinking this tea while visiting Table Mountain. It gets rather chilly up there when you are overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

I'm an active home cook and a rather intense one (we make our own vanilla, roast our own coffee beans), so it's no surprise that I'd say the results aren't as good as homemade.

That era has ended simply because I was beginning to get sick of paying over $2.00 for one can. I know several distributors who offer the product for $1.50, but I seldomly stock up on the stuff and end up paying the $2.00 for a can plus 8% tax, which comes out to $2.15 a can. Which is fine with me until you realize that you are spending over 700 dollars a year at this rate. It never stopped me before and I always felt that it was worth it, considering the drink helps me focus in college each morning. However, I recently noticed that on days when I was not in school and I drank a Red Bull, rather than being full of energy and ready to jog, I would become tired. I began to wonder why I would get tired after drinking a can of Red Bull. Maybe my inner body was saying, ""stop drinking this **** every freaking day of your life!"" Whatever the case is, I decided to stop buying it on a daily basis and just drink it when I have to wake up very early. Hopefully this can make it become effective on my body again, because I think I may have overdone it, considering I have probably consumed well over 1000 cans in my life. 

I personally enjoy drinking a cold can of Red Bull. Set aside the energy factor. While many people (actually everyone I know) says it is sick and makes them gag, I kinda like that cough droppy taste that is offered in a can of Red Bull. I find Red Bull to be a conversation starter for myself - kinda like smoker talk. I love to sip from my can of Red Bull and discuss the weather or some other exciting news with my peers. While I have tried so many other energy drinks, I can say that I do hate all of them. There has never been an energy drink that I enjoyed other than Red Bull. I guess I just like the Austrian people so much (and the fact that a can of Red Bull is vegan!) On the other hand, it is full of man-made chemicals that might do some weird things to me in the future - only time will tell"

As a college student, sure.  Maybe a box once and a while as a young married couple.  But as a new mom my motto was ""my child won't be eating..."".  [Actually you could fill in a number of items into that space.]

And yet, I find myself the purveyor of many, many meals that involve noodles and cheese.  Once in awhile these may be whole wheat organic noodles, but more often than not it is one of the few foods my stubborn toddler-now preschooler will eat:  Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.

Pros
--Lets face it the biggest pro is that testy tikes will eat it.  Let's call it ""Tasty"" then.
--The meal is quick and has 9 grams of protein per serving.
--It has no transfats unless YOU add them.
--Provides 10% of Adult Iron requirements-which translates as an even higher percentage for children.

Cons
--Cost a buck per box on Amazon.
--Since wheat flour is `processed' doesn't have a lot of fiber (1 gram).
--Processed flour probably means higher glycemic index (though that should be moderated by the addition of oil/butter and milk.
--Lots of sodium (740 mg).
--Lots of calories (380 prepared per  adult serving) which is not necessarily bad if you are trying to fill up a toddler.

Four Stars.  My greatest wish would be for an organic, whole wheat with flax Kraft Mac & Cheese, but until that day comes I am happy that Kraft makes a tasty, affordable, meal in a box that children will eat.  Just add veg and you are ready to go"

Dreamfields is a happy exception.  This is not to say you can cook up a whole box and eat it all at once (those who have to watch carb intake will still need to do some portion control), but you can actually have a large scoop of delicious hot pasta alone or in your culinary creations and not blow your carb allowance.  And this is not some flimsy, dissolving, cardboard-tasting pasta; it cooks up hearty and substantial.

So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications.

I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.

This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.

The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.

I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.

For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety. 

Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).

The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation"

Many winning recipes from the International Chili Society use Gebhardt's as a base. In my kitchen, it is an excellent start to a good bowl of red. I have used this chili mix several times and always end up with good chili.

This mix supplies no thickener, no salt, and no heat. These you must add yourself, which is a good thing; you can really customize to your liking. This my preference per pound of meat: 1 tablespoon of Gebhardt's, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, and no thickener. I also find that this mix needs (per # of meat): 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon tomato paste, 1 teaspoon of cumin seed, 1 teaspoon of MEXICAN (not greek) oregano. 

I have always enjoyed chili made with this mix, and highly recommend it as a standard ingredient on your shelf. A fabulous way to prepare a whole pot of meat for those summer events."

My only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry.  So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth.  I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries.

This gum is very hard to describe. It has a wonderful, perfumed scent that makes you think that it will taste like some sort of chemical, but nothing can be further from the truth. This gum has a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath.

When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Violet Mints and Violet Gum. Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the taste of these candies takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy.

So, if you want a gum that tastes like NOTHING you've ever had before, one that freshens your breath and excites your palette, then buy this gum. It's fantastic"

I've tried 70+ varieties of tea in the past year.  Some the many brands I've tried include Tazo, Stash, Adagio, Republic of Tea, Twinings, Harrogate's, and Market Spice. Tea sampling has become a fun little hobby for me.

After reading a tea gourmand's review stating that she tried numerous high-end bagged teas -- Barry's, Yorkshire Gold, PG Tips, and the like -- only to find she kept coming back to Tazo's Awake, I decided to give ""Awake"" a try.  I fell in love at first sip.   I have 3 large mahoghany tea chests filled with various tea bags, but this is the tea I drink everyday.  I enjoy a cup of ""Awake"" each morning, with a dab of milk.  It's my new religion.  

This tea is not for everyone. My husband acted disdainful toward ""Awake"" when he tasted it, saying it kinda reminded him of everyday Liptons tea. (Interestingly, I later read a survey saying that a bunch of blind-folded gourmands tasted something like 20 cups of various teas, only to unaminously choose -- LIPTON'S!!! The magazine said that all the taste-testers were shocked when they learned that they choose Liptons over the gourmet tea blends! hahaha)

I don't know why I find this tea so addictive.  Perhaps it's strong, rich flavor that appeals to the coffee drinker in me?  Regardless of the reason, I highly recommend you give this tea a try if you like assertively-flavored teas."

This ""English Breakfast"" style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious. 

I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. I use my coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the loose tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.

The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in the TAZO teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers.

This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying. If you are looking for a rich black tea, then this should impress you.

It does!  And when the sugar boils down into syrup, the flavor comes out.  So, okay -- it IS sugar.  Politically incorrect.  Empty calories.... I know, I know.  But whether you take your sugar ""naturally"" in fruit or honey or ""unnaturally"" in hiprocessed candies and sugar-coated cereals, the chemical is the same....And the thing is not to get too much. And if I'm going to have a certain amount ANYway, there are days when this is how I want to eat it.  Ly'les Golden Syrup is  a nice flavor alternative to honey, or maple syrup.  The texture is thick like honey, but the flavor is light.  It has much more ""depth"" and thickness than corn syrup.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","Sullivan, Illinois United States","Twinkies rank high on my list of pure junk foods.  The sugar and corn syrup in Twinkies help push the calorie count to around 150.  I do not care to think about what kind of fats and carbs go in to the 150 calories.

On the other hand, I grew up with Twinkies.  I used to eat them as fast as I could get my hands on them.  Unfortunately, I am unable to do that any more.  You get older, you get smarter, I guess.  But I still like an occasional Twinkie.  Yes, they are sweet.  Yes, they have too many calories.  But, they taste good!  I wish they still offered banana creme Twinkies.

More recently people have actually enhanced the calories in a Twinkie by deep frying them.  Cooking a Twinkie should be something you do only with great care.  There is a process to successfully making a deep fried Twinkie, and there are many processes that do not work.  To the best of my knowledge all of the processes yield even more calories, but even better flavor.  You get the general idea.  The better Twinkies taste, the more calories they have.  Go figure.

Twinkies in their current form will never be mistaken for a health food.  But I will probably continue to indulge in one periodically for as long as I can.

Enjoy!"

Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.

The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as ""creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes.  Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""minty, hay like, rose"". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.

If you like your Chai with a peppery kick, then this tea will interest you. Rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, decaffeinated black tea, cardamom, ginger, chicory, cloves, star anise and other natural flavors seem to take a back seat to the delicious peppery flavor of this tea. This tea tastes similar to a tea I first tasted in Africa, where Rooibos tea is grown. 

Best served with milk/powdered milk/soy milk or a dash of cream and some honey. Since this is a decaffeinated tea, it is perfect for late night writing sessions or when you want something calming to drink that doesn't taste like chamomile.

After being without wheat for 5 years and trying to forced down ready made breads yuck! The taste is delicious. Sweeter than most breads. You have to try her browning mix it is great. You wont believe it is not wheat. I read the ingredients several times. I havent had any abdominal problems or broke out with blister on my hands so I am certain it dose not have any wheat. I have made 5 loafs and all have turned out great.

Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:
AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter
CALM:  nice chamomile tea
CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine
CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no ""natural flavorings""
DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine
EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience 
LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's
PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious
WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps
ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea

Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.

Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only ""real"" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.

B0006ZN4WU:a_protein_shake_that_tastes_good:karen,B0006ZN4WU,Powdered Egg Whites - 2.25 Pound Can: Gourmet Food,gourmet food,,5.0,A protein shake that tastes good,"April 19, 2007",Karen,"Eden Prairie, MN USA","I have been weight training and trying to eat a higher protein diet.  I can no longer bear the sight of turkey, egg-white omelets or cottage cheese.  I dislike artificial sweeteners (mostly due to their taste) so I don't care for any pre-made shakes I have tried.  I turned to whey protein (bleck...maybe more experimentation will yield something better)and soy protein (bleck redux) but couldn't stand them.

But I like this!  I wouldn't eat it plain (it's not THAT good), but the taste is easily coverable with yummy and healthy additives.  This morning I made a ""shake"" that was 1C OJ (Tropicana Grovestand), 1/4C (appx) pure pomegranate juice, 1/4C egg whites (22g protein), 1/4C (appx) plain non-fat yogurt, and one banana. I blended these together with a few ice cubes, and yum!  Even my kids love it!  

It probably has a lot of naturally occuring sugar from the fruits and yogurt, but I am happy with the content and nutrients, and I can drink it happily without forcing it down!  

I have tried the Honeyville dried fruits and been pretty happy with them as well (much better blueberries than for pancakes), so I will look forward to adding these for variety when I can't find good fresh fruit"

It is completely natural and almost 100% protein.  Low carb count.  Highly bioavailable protein.  

When mixed with only water it does have a strange aftertaste.  I use powdered Nestles that only has 2 carbs or so and it has definitely improved the taste and removed any aftertaste.  

Do not use a shaker bottle with this.  Shaking the egg whites will cause them to foam, ( since they want to increase in volume).  Use a whisk or fork.

I have used this product for baking power-type bars and it has worked flawlessly.  I am confident that it would work with other dishes.  However, I am not sure if I would use it for meringues.  I haven't tested it, but it does seem to increase in volume rather quickly.  Maybe it could be used as a last resort for fresh egg whites"

The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.
      
As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea. 
      
Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality. 
      
Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores. 
      
I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!    
      
Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!"

The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source: 

Caffeine 

Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.

Enough said.........enjoy your tea............"

Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as ""tart, sweet, smooth, licorice"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""oranges, roses, lime"".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.

W. LeChat ""Booger the Clown""","Big Timber, MT., USA","Man I love me some cukes!  So much so that I take them everywhere I go.  Foolishly I brought a 2-pack with me recently on a flight to London.  The TSA eye-balled me for several minutes, discussed the cukes for 20 minutes more, and finally pulled me out of line.  ""Cucumbers are 90% liquid!"" they told me, ""NO LIQUIDS on any flights from now on!!""  I was strip-searched, questioned for 6 hours, forced to remove all liquid from my bladder, and held in a locked room overnight until the authorities finally let me go.  

I have come to the unpleasant realization that the terrorists are winning.  We can never beat them if we are always playing ""catch-up"" with them, enacting new rules AFTER they try something.  It seems the only way to win is to declare indefinite martial law, place soldiers everywhere, and arrest everyone suspicious.  Unfortunately this tactic didn't help the Soviets win the cold war, and besides-- if the terrorists ""hate us for our freedom"" aren't we just playing into their hands by removing those freedoms (which we seem to be doing a little at a time now anyway)?  If we're going to play into their hands, why not just cut to the chase and give them what they want now-- DEFUSE the whole situation by pushing for a free and seperate Palestine in the occupied west bank, and remove our troops from Iraq and Saudi Arabia (substituing a U.N. or NATO peacekeeping force in Iraq).  Then they'd have NOTHING to fight for anymore.  Al Quaeda might be seen as heroes at first, but would look craven and evil to most muslims if they continued to try and blow up infidels across the globe, thus completely alienating them from the peaceful muslim majority.  Checkmate!  Besides, are we not a ""Christian nation"" for the most part?  Shouldn't we follow Christ's example by ""turning the other cheek""?  

It's hard to believe a simple cucumber could make me rethink all of my long-held Republican ideals (McCain on '08, baby!!), but if I have to choose between eternal war, and a humbling (maybe embarassing) peace, well. . . it's no contest.  When a dirty, smelly hippy flashes the ""peace"" sign at me, I will smile and return the favor.  GOD BLESS AMERICA and the amazing CUCUMBER!"

2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder
1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)
10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)

Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any.

So my favorite teas are this matcha & white loose leaf teas. The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price"

Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent ""natural flavors"" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!

The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these ""natural flavors"" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor."" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as ""grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""vegetative, popcorn"". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.

It isn't like typical American hot chocolate. It has a very intense, dark chocolate flavor, undoubtably due to the 60-70% cocoa content of the chocolate shavings used and the omission of vanilla flavoring. It is also not as sweet, which I came to prefer after a few cups.

A few recommendations would be to use milk (you can even use skim without hurting the results), and 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup. If you get this product, I'd also recommend that you invest in an AeroLatte or some other milk frother. I could never get the chocolate pieces evenly distributed without it.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","New York, NY USA","I am not a huge fan of Godiva chocolates. I realize it is a popular brand and a big favorite for many, but their chocolate has always tasted slightly waxy to me, and their fillings lack creaminess. I recently had the opportunity to taste the Godiva ""G"" Collection and was surprised at the spectacular presentation and by many of the superb flavors. This new, high-end line was presented over the Christmas holidays with much success. Many places sold out long before December 25.
 
The core collection consists of fifteen selections, crafted in sleek shapes and adorned with brilliant colors. The overall presentation is strikingly beautiful and super-luxurious. Godiva calls this collection ""A true fusion of art and chocolate."" The individual jewel-like pieces look like miniature paintings - tiny masterpieces. The Passion Orange Heart is gorgeous and tastes as wonderful as it looks. Mixed Berry, a buttery reduction of pureed raspberries, strawberries, and wild blackberries is another standout - truly exceptional. The Praline Crunch, in which hazelnut praline is combined with rich milk chocolate, is delicious, as is the 3-sided Vanilla Mascarpone made with fresh exotic vanilla from Madagascar. The Orange Gianduja in a dark chocolate ganache is exquisite, and Key Lime Pie chocolate cream is unusual and good. I didn't like the coconut truffle at all, however. I hate to sound too picky, but given the high cost per piece, I should have loved, or at least liked, every single one! Also, the ingredients list includes hydrogenated fats and artificial flavors - which certainly diminish the quality of the line.

A young American, Norman Love, created the ""G"" Collection. He was the ex-Executive Pastry Chef for the Ritz-Carlton Hotels and is founder of Ganache Chocolates in Fort Myers, Florida. 

Weighing in at about $100 per pound, these chocolates are worth their weight in gold. Although I would rate most of the pieces 4-5 stars for flavor and a solid 5 stars for visual presentation, there are extraordinary chocolates on the market today - Belgian, French, Swiss, Dutch, American - which are better in terms of fresh, natural ingredients and consistent quality and they are definitely easier on the pocketbook.

Godiva's ""G"" Collection does make a superlative gift and I highly recommend it for those very special occasions. This is memorable candy!

This ""English Breakfast"" style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious. 

I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves. 

The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers. 

This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying. Passion and Chai are also favorites.

That's your life that's whizzing by...,"November 2, 2006","Hap ""Flint And Roses""","Austin,TX United States","I love tea and coffee; they are one of great pleaures of being an adult. I drink a lot of different teas and I enjoy herb teas, teasans, white tea with jasmine, and chai as well as a good strong cup of Yorkshire with some cream and sugar accompanied by a couple of McVities Digestive Biscuits (uh..cookies...that's just Brit for wheat cookies- they are delicious and Amazon carries them in the Gourmet section.) I am not above a bag of Lipton if it comes to that (which, quite frankly, I always hope it won't.)

Numi teas are quite simply, the most delicious teas I have ever had the pleasure to brew. The Flowering Dragon Lily should be brewed in a clear glass pot (also available at Amazon or at the Numi website) to see the amazing blossoming of the handsewn tea flower.  The brew time is only a few minutes but you should be aware that rushing this experience deprives you of the subtle aromas and slow beauty of the brew. Each blossom can be used for up to three small pots of tea. The simple beauty of the blossoming brew will enrich any break or meditation time you are taking. Your life will slow down to its lovely essence. This tea transports you. It's amazing.

I first became acquainted with Numi teas when I bought a box of Monkey King at the local co-op. What a shock to discover that the simple box of tea I bought contained a world of flavors, fragrances and satisfaction. Numi is committed to fair trade and giving back to the environment, too. There's just no downside to the experience. I've enjoyed many of thier teas and I've NEVER had a cup that was not subtle, charming and elegant.

Numi Tea becomes a wonderful experience instead of a quickly sloshed cup of caffeinated muck. It slows down your racing thoughts, halts your worries and refreshes your spirit. I know it sounds too good to be true but this tea is something rare and magical. (okay, the first time I had a shot of Wild Turkey, that was magical, too.) 

It's really good tea. Maybe you'll slow down a little and enjoy the moment. This tea could help you with that, No kidding"

A snack bar that tastes good!,"January 12, 2007",James W. Picht,"Louisiana, USA","I bought these cherry bars so that I'd have something to snack on in the office. I've bought a lot of different breakfast/nutrition bars and have grown used to boredom, disappointment, and sore jaw muscles when I chew them. I had no high expectations for these, but I liked my first one so much that I promptly unwrapped and ate a second. I wanted to make sure that I didn't just think it was good compared to all the horrible or boring bars I've eaten, but that it was actually good. It was. Don't get me wrong, a fresh chocolate chip cookie is better, but a chocolate chip cookie isn't a reasonable snack on its own, either.

So are these things healthy? Total fat is 9g, of which 6g are monounsaturated and 3g are polyunsaturated. None is trans fat. Total carbohydrate is 24g, of which 4g are fiber and 17g are sugar. Protein is 5g. No sodium, no cholesterol, 240mg of potassium. Ingredients are dates, almonds, and cherries. That's it. It's uncooked, vegan, and kosher. Healthy? Not as a substitute for lunch on a daily basis and not if you can't have any sugar in your diet, but much better than a candy bar or a cookie, and quite good if your diet is generally balanced. In fact, I think they're an excellent snack from both a taste and a nutritional perspective. The apple pie flavor is also excellent. My wife doesn't much care for the chocolate coconut chew, but I like it quite a lot, and I'm a chocolate snob. Oh, and this is important - my kids like them. My son comes over to my office after school, and he always used to want something from my candy bowl. I now keep that bowl full of almonds and pecans, but he likes these bars so much that he hasn't complained about the disappearing candy"

These are great!,"January 30, 2006","Mr. Picky ""t_h_b""",NYC,"What excellent sardines these are!  They are not packed in soybean oil, but in pure olive oil, so they are HEART HEALTHY.  Even though the oil is not first-pressed (""virgin""), it matters little because it is infused with the flavor of the sardines.  Eating sardines is good for you because the skeletons contain TONS of calcium, which is necessary for healthy bones.  If all of those little old hunch-backed ladies had eaten a tin of these every day, their spines would be as healthy as any young whippersnapper's.

I love to take a couple of cans of these with me when I go fishing--they go great with Ritz crackers just as well as with saltines.  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night craving a sardine, and these really scratch that itch.

The leftover oil makes a wonderful conditioner for your hair--just massage it in and leave it overnight.  Your hair will be super-shiny and smell good, too!

I feel good about buying these because Norwegians, in my experience, are quite clean.  The sardines are actually cooked RIGHT IN THE TIN, after it is sealed, so the inside is practically sterile.  (That's why the fish don't decompose in there until after you open it.)

That reminds me:  I cannot give this five stars because sometimes the key is missing and the tin must be opened with a pair of needle-nose pliers because the can opener won't go around the corner as the radius is too tight"

Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.
 
This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices.

Heyser ""easier_rhino""",,"A little while back, no one had ever heard of chipotle, other than the people who make them.  Then suddenly the dam burst and chipotle came flooding into our land like a spicy tide.  We all love those smokey peppers, and at this point there really isn't anything you can't get with chipotle in it.  Chipotle peanut butter, chipotle caramel corn, chipotle coffee beans... we have been inundated by chipotle.

So you might think that this is just another chipotle hot sauce.  How quaint, you think, a chipotle product that actually seems like it should have chipotle in it.  You look at your friends and you all say ""Hey, let's be retro and buy some chipotle hot sauce.""  You buy a bottle, take it home, and put some on your microwave burrito while watching Championship Poker on ESPN.

Suddenly your eyes widen, your burrito slips from your hands, and you rise, zombie-like, all thoughts of televised card games forgotten.  For you see, this stuff is much better than ""just another chipotle"" hot sauce.  If that's what you're looking for, there are plenty out there, usually overpriced and drab.  This stuff is totally different.

The taste sensation is difficult to describe.  It's spicy, very spicy, but the burn is coated with a sweet smokey flavor that makes you eat far too much of it before you realize your throat has burst into flames.  And I say sweet because I mean it.  It's sweet, like chipotle honey, not bitter as many hot sauces based in vinegar (which is great too, just different) are.

And by gum, it's good on microwave burritos.  You don't have to live in shame.  Pour it on.  If you can find it in a store, it's cheap too.  What more can you ask for?  Buy it now!  Do it"

Now for the goods: These vanilla beans are a fantastic value.  Seriously, I wasn't expecting much- I was hopeful given the other reviews- but I've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items-  These beans are even superior to those I can get from my local provider (at three times the cost, mind you.)  I've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by Martha Stewart, lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers.  (Plump and supple- always a good thing.)

If you're on the fence- I urge you to go for it.  You owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I'm not.

I took exception to the reviewer who said this was a flavored coffee. It is NOT! Since his synopsis appears to be directed at me, I felt he needed to be straightened out on this.

One small word of warning - Beware - this stuff is toxic mixed with alcohol. You'll have one heck of a hangover the next day.

My Family are all from Texas.  Since I was a wee little tyke (60 years ago) I remember my Grandmother, Effie, cooking with Gebhardt's chili powder.  Nothing else would do and since Effie (who was known to all as Grannie) taught my Mom how to cook; Gebhardt's is the only chili powder any of us would every use.  

Okay, okay, so I did try to cut costs sometimes when I was younger and bought the grocery store chili powders but the taste was definitely not the same and it seemed things cooked with that mess were not edible either.  

I wish they would sell Gebhardt's in a bigger bottle because I usually have 3 or 4 bottles in my cupboard and I am scared of running out when I am in the middle of cooking something great like red beans and rice, or Grannie's mexican skillet, tamale pie, chili, red eye stew,  stuffed peppes, omlette mexican, on and on.  

Grannie's Goulash

Cook 1 1/2 cups long grain rice (I used Texmati you will end up with about 3 cups rice)

note:  I am a vegetarian so I do not use bacon grease anymore but it is really good with bacon grease instead of vegetable oil.

In a large skillet Brown 1 pound ground meat in some 
4 tablspoons olive oil or corn oil when it starts getting almost browned, 
add 1 large chopped onion, 
2 or 3 cloves garlic chopped, and 
1 large or two smal bell peppers in about 1/2 inch cubes (can add some chopped big hunks of two ribs celery)(can use red bell peppers also). 

Cook until onions are sweated and garlic as well. On low heat - Add about 4 tablespoons of Gebhardt's Chili Powder (at least I use more) and if you have some ground cumin put a spoon of that in too. Stir it around so the chili powder has a good absorption of oil, salt and pepper to taste.

YOu can add a packet of Sauzon achiote & cilantro or a packet of Azrafan but it's not really necessary because the disk takes its main flavor from the Gebhardt's

If you can get hold of a can of Rotel tomatoes (drain most of the water off), or  you can add about 1.5 cups tomato sauce, or chopped tomatoes, or even thick tomato juice, and salsa works good too.  

Add 1.5 cups whole kernel corn (I use frozen) you can put in a can of Mexicorn and it looks good too.

1 Cup kidney or pinto beans from the can or that you have made.

Stir this around and simmer on low heat until heated through.

When it is all heated put in 1.5 cups to 2 cups of rice heat and toss well but lightly so as not to mush the rice.

I serve this with grated cheese on top but you can put cilantro, chopped tomato, sliced olives, avacado and even a plop of sour cream.  One dish meal easy clean up leftovers are great next day in an omlette or on a tortilla.

This recipe is very fogiving and so you can pretty much use what you have on hand. Grannie Effie had 6 children and fed most of the neighborhood during the drepression"

Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet. 

The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, juicy, red fruits"". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.

Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water. 

The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey. 

I love Tazo Teas and have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have always been impressed. 

I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients. Caffeine Free. 

You can drink this as you type into the night...

It is an excellent quality tea, balanced in flavor and balanced in terms of the sense of well-being it imparts to the imbiber.  It helps me to concentrate better and helps to even out my moods.  It feels like a good detoxifier to take after eating a meal with a lot of saturated fats or meat, partly because of its anti-inflammatory effects.  It has less caffeine than regular tea or coffee.  Just enough caffeine to give a slight elevation of mood, but not enough to cause one to hyper-concentrate and feel mood swings.  Of course, this tea consists of loose leaves and twigs, and not tea bags.  This is an important concept.  In a typical supermarket, the tea comes in bags and has too much caffeine and is overly processed, which reduces its nutritional value dramatically.  In general, green tea bought from a popular brand in a supermarket does not contribute to the reputation for health that green tea has.  This kind of green tea that is in the natural form is the only kind that does.  I brew it by microwaving water to boiling, then letting the water cool for a couple minutes while stirring it with a spoon to agitate out any oxygen dissolved in the water.  Then put a heaping teaspoon of the tea in it and let it sit for 3-4 minutes.  Very hot but not boiling water is the key.  You will likely find that consuming natural forms of green tea like this one, raw and unroasted, is far superior to drinking most popular brands of tea from the supermarket, or to drinking coffee"
