"B0002E3FGK:natural_quality_light,_but_heavy_and_somewhat_obtrusive.:t._hassler",B0002E3FGK,Pro Tec Mighty Bright Sight Reader: Musical Instruments,musical instruments,10 of 10,2.0,"Natural quality light, but heavy and somewhat obtrusive.","December 20, 2005",T. Hassler,,"I got this light before the LED lights started coming out in the retail channel.  Those lights tend to almost be too bright, but they have the advantage of running for ages on tiny batteries.  Unfortunately, this light uses 4 AA batteries which makes it fairly hefty.  It alternatively can operate on an AC adapter.  This makes it lighter, but it's still bulky because of the battery compartment.

The Good:
The light is nicely bright with a natural quality that's easy on the eyes.
It has a ratcheting arm so you can put it where you want and it stays there (better than most of the flexible arm ones)
Includes an AC adapter slot (though no AC adapter)
Can help weigh down lighter books to keep the pages from turning
Nice large clamp for attaching to books.
Lamp shade which allows you to throw the light where you want without blinding your vision.
Decent quality plastic - Made in China

The Bad:
No brightness adjustment.
Heavy (can be a benefit in some cases) and makes holding up a book all the more tiring.
Bulky - Makes it really hard for a book to sit properly in your hand.
The ratcheting mades a loud click which can wake your wife in bed.  :-)
The clip has very limited strength and seems to slip easily.
Eats up batteries fairly quickly - I use rechargeables in it now.

I'm giving it an even 2 because it's a pain to use, really.  Hopefully I can find a light weight LED clip-on which has a brightness adjustment with a quiet arm that stays in place and most importantly - natural lighting.  If so, I'll review it on here - but most LEDs wash out the page making it hard to read.  The nice quality lamp is the only reason this one doesn't get 1.5 stars"

It literally came in the cardboard box that you would buy it off of the shelf in with no packing besides a plastic bag around the guitar like your newspaper would come in. There was NO PACKAGING SLIP. I took it out of the plastic and the body of the guitar was damaged around the edge. There was a little divit the size of a raisin where it looked like it had hit something pretty hard. There was literally slack in the strings, so they had to be tightened. It would not stay in tune and I would tighten the strings and you could see them loosen again immediately. My little boy began to play with the out of tune guitar that sounded TERRIBLE and the next day one of the strings broke!!! This toy is a piece of junk. The sales pitch says a fully functional guitar... great value for the money.... HAHAHA! I thought this would be a great starter guitar with little investment. I would only recommend this if you are needing a prop or decoration of some kind. It certainly isn't playable!

Moore ""Nate Moore""",NW Florida,"The only song I know with a 12-string electric in it is Rush's Xanadu, so I let 'er rip.  Sounded good.  I had alot of fun playing around with it.  However, after an hour or so of goofing around I noticed two things that really ticked me off.  Firstly, the outer tines had already broken.  The tines look like a wound steel guitar string, but the core is very brittle.  They didn't completely fall off, they just hung there like limp whatevers.  Secondly, the plastic p'up cover and pick guard looked like they had been scrubbed with a wire brush.  I can easily fix those, but I wonder what such an abrasive pick will do to the strings if I play it alot.  It looks like you can only strum on the down stroke.  Videos of the jellyfish website confirm this.  The problem is you're going against the grain on the upstroke and it catches on the strings.  How much fun is it to only play down strokes?  It's kind of hard grasp, too.  It needs a thumb dimple.

I'm going to make one using more flexible wound guitar stings to see if its any better.

It would be... if it worked like it's supposed to. 

Actually I'm on my second set right now, and this one is about to go back for a refund. The first set I had the pads were so insensitive as to make the unit nearly unplayable. What I mean by this is that there was maybe a square inch or so of a sweet spot where the pads would sound at all, and even then I really had to strike hard. The second set I'm on now is far better in response than the first, but still falls short of acceptable. 

For starters, the pads don't feel like a real drum skin at all. If one were to compare against an acoustic snare drum for example, the snare has a certain ""bounce"" to it that this unit doesn't have. Basically the pads absorb most of the impact, and this in turn makes doing any kind of fast work or rudiments all but impossible. 

Also, even though my second set is more responsive from the first, I have found that it still takes a considerable amount of force in comparison to a real drum to get the pads to sound off. Keep in mind that the pads themselves are only 4 inches or so in diameter... an actual snare starts at 12"". In all fairness though, I really can't hold the pad size alone against the DD-20 as Yamaha did have to keep the overall size and cost manageable, and in reality if there weren't the feel and responsiveness issue, the pad size should be sufficient. HOWEVER, when these combined factors are taken into consideration, I have found that it makes for a frustrating experience. 

My opinion for what it's worth, is that new drummers who are looking to the DD-20 to learn on should do it the old-school way, and start with a quality practice pad instead. They are considerably less expensive (a ReelFeel 12"" pad and sticks will run about half of what this unit costs), indestructible, easier to work with, and offer at least a reasonable approximation of the feel of a real drum. Not only that, but a pad also inherently allows for quiet practice.

Maybe Yamaha will fix the feel and sensitivity problems with the next revision of this drum set... then it might be worth it. Until then, I feel that the DD-20C is best avoided."

It is the main stay of many a hire companies microphone hire stock, including mine (pa2hire.co.uk).  Practically unbreakable, and if you do manage to drop it from a high stage / skyscraper, you can also buy a replacement pop shield.  Very suited to rock, or other musical styles that need powerful vocals.  Make sure your singers lips are touching the pop shield to get the best results, though, unless they have very good mic technique.  The proximity effect (increase in bass when you sing or talk close to the mic) makes this important.  If the singer is a foot away from an SM58, the chances are they will sound thin, and you will also have gain before feedback issues....
Sonically the response has a nice presence peak in the upper mid range, but the top end rolls off quickly after that.  Opinion is split about whether that is a good or a bad thing - it helps keep a lid on feedback, but it doesnt sound as hi-fi as some other mics.  I have had some singers complain that their vocal top end is not quite right - sometimes asking for more top end.  I guess they are used to the sound of expensive condenser mics on their recordings.  My solution is normally to give them another mic, like a Beta 58, or Beta 87a maybe, rather than use EQ.  If you A/B test an SM58 verses these mics it will always lose.  But it can still be a better mic in some cases, such as when you are looking for a cardioid rather than hyper-cardioid response (the SM58 has a cardioid response, which means it has a wider pickup pattern at the front).  But most vocalists will be more than happy with the sound the SM58 gives.
The SM58 also does a pretty good job on drums (not really bass drum), and other loud things like guitar cabs.  It uses the same capsule as the SM57, one of the best mics for guitar cabs.
In conclusion, yes there are a lot of mics that sound better, and some of these are quite a bit cheaper - but ask yourself the question are they as durable as an SM58, and if you are a professional, will your clients want to use a mic they have never heard of? 

Take care,

 My current primary SM58 has a couple dents from rough use in rough venues but sounds just like it did brand new.  The only reason I've ever replaced one is because they were stolen.  If you're just starting your professional career, this is the microphone you need.  If you're a seasoned veteran of the music biz, you've probably already got one in your gig bag.  

Get a Shure SM58, don't use some crappy thing that costs half as much, you won't get enough level into the board.  Your sound guy will thank you, they know just exactly what to expect.

I can't imagine a better set of headphones. 
There is a clear difference between these and my earbuds - although I can lie on my side with my head on the pillow with the earbuds and with the Grado I have to stay on my back. But they are so comfortable I don't mind it.
The other set of Grado I keep by my rowing machine. I appreciate the long, heavy, indestructible cord. On that set I listen to loud rock and roll or traditional Irish music. It never gets harsh as I turn up the volume and it sounds great. I know there are more expensive cans out there but I doubt the improvement would justify the higher price.

Marranca,"Norwalk, CT, USA","I finally caved in and sprung for a pair of these headphones over the weekend. After a few days, I can say that I am truly impressed.

I have bought and returned many a pair of headphones after being dissatisfied. I will not be doing so with these. Accordingly, I'll try to write some comments that could help other people with their purchase. There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting headphones. It's also important to keep in mind that with any headphones, sound quality depends on the quality of the medium to which you are listening, as well as the ability of the device to drive the headphones.

My immediate impression of the SR60'swas that bass was a bit weak (matching a few other comments on here) AND that high-end treble was a bit subdued as well - but after a few days of trying different kinds of music and listening on different players, I have decided that neither is weak at all; sounds are simply much more accurately reproduced than with most of the headphones I'd previously experienced. Very significant: these headphones maintain almost identical tonal balance regardless of listening volume. I've never encountered that before, and was used to headphones that sound more ""bright"" or ""warm"" as volume increases. 

I believe that most budget headphones, if they aren't completely lacking in bass, tend to exaggerate certain frequencies beyond what you'd hear in a live performance. Here's my logic:

I tried listening to a few different tracks with the SR60s, all high-bitrate MP3s:

-- Pride & Prejudice Soundtrack (2005) - Dario Marianelli - ""Liz On Top Of The World"" - (Orchestral, dominated by piano and strings) - Any concerns about weak bass were blown out the door within 30 seconds. It honestly sounded like a *real piano* was sitting in my living room. And who knew that a string section could have so much ambiance? I used to appreciate this track for its music; the notes carry a lot of emotion. I now understand what people mean about appreciating a particular *performance* as well. 

-- Alison Krauss & Union Station - ""The Lucky One"" -  (Vocal, bluegrass) - You can clearly discern *specific* guitar picks, the streaking noises made by musicians' fingers as they slide up and down the strings... And Alison Krauss' crystal clear voice just shines. It sounds like a live performance. 

-- Max Graham feat. Jessica Jacobs - ""I Know You re Gone"" (Original Mix) - (Vocal Trance) - I've much ballyhooed this track as one of the all time best examples of vocal trance. It was also a good sound testing song, since it's based on a throbbing bass line and bouncy rhythms, but breaks down into a section where it's just Jessica's voice, piano, and strings. I must have listened to this song 200 times in the last year, and yet I picked up several new nuances on the first listen with these headphones. 

A few negatives about these headphones, now that I've played with them: 

-- Yes, they are bulky. You probably won't want to use them at the gym. I was able to tolerate them on the treadmill, but for actually lifting weights or otherwise doing things requiring changes in posture, I'll probably stick with my Koss KSC75's (an awesome bargain themselves at less than $20, though now that I've tried the Grados, the Koss bass seems a bit artificially inflated). 

-- These *really* leak sound. On a whim, I spun the headphones and put them on so that the outside was on my ears, with the foam pads facing outward. They actually sounded louder that way (if muffled) than with the drivers properly facing my ears. The open air design has it's advantages - I think it's partly how these headphones create the illusion of sitting among the musicians - but people around you may think you are blasting your music even if it isn't really that loud to you.

-- These headphones *will* expose flaws in the source media, and possibly your playback device as well. I can't stomach 128kbps MP3s anymore. When your headphones get this accurate, such music seems to have had the life flattened out of it. I tried listening to a few Beatles songs, and there were certain frequencies missing. It sounded like I was listening to a reel-to-reel tape. Oh wait, the songs were probably mastered on reel-to-reel.

My overall impression is extremely favorable. Sure, sound quality is a somewhat subjective matter, but if your goal is life-like sound, and you want to come closer to what the studio recording sounded like, these headphones are an awesome effort for the price."

In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like triangles, sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. 

This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the traingl or make up your own percussion accompaniment."

My parole officer advised me that creative activities such as playing an instrument tend to show us how cultured and worthwhile the lives of humans are, rather than looking on one's fellow man as a fetid and putrid beast.  I have always enjoyed listening to music and whilst not being equipped to learn any complex instrument percussion is definitely where it's at for me!

I purchased this pulse triangle as a means of beginning the road to becoming the next Phil Collins or Ringo Star.  I found the Pulse Triangle to be easy to use and rewarding in the results.  I am able to add my own accompaniment to most tunes, from Fleetwood Mac's 'Albatross' to Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teenspirit'.  I did have some trouble mastering the later as higher tempo tunes tend to be difficult to keep up with.  My girlfriend likened me to an epileptic gymnast as she watched me playing along to the William Tell Overture.

In summary if you are looking for a way into music and want a simple instrument that tests the water then the Pulse Triangle is for you.  It's cheap, enjoyable and very forgiving.  However it is not recommended for playing naked"

Ross,"Minneapolis, Minnesota USA","I shopped online for probably two months before finally settling on these headphones.  I wanted nice headphones to compliment my iPod, yet at an affordable price.  The AKG K 27i is the perfect solution.  After looking at other models by AKG, and other brands like Sennheiser and Bose, I thought I would have to spend at least $100 in order to get quality, but then I found these and I snatched them up.

The sound is excellent.  When I first plugged them in, I thought they were a little quiet.  But, then I discovered that there is a lanyard-style volume switch on the headphones themselves, which is fantastic.  I don't have to reach into my pocket to turn the volume up or down on my iPod.  The sound is very crisp and articulate, with deep, accentuating bass.  And because these headphones are designed for portable mp3 players, my iPod is powerful enough to really push the drivers of the headphones.

The soft ear pads offer great comfort for long listening (and sound dampening! They block out a lot of ambient noise!), but the headband takes some getting used to, as it is a little bit tight.  Once you adjust to it though, you can wear them for hours.

The last thing I will mention is the style.  These headphones look great and the colors compliment the white iPod really well.  They also fold up to an incredibly compact size, and they even come with a travel pouch.  Now that is convenient.

If you are looking for great headphones for your portable mp3 player, I truly say look no further.  I did so much research before settling on these, that I feel like I became an expert in the audio field.  The AKG K 27i offers amazing sound, great comfort, compact size, and best of all, affordability"

Using a Metronome: All of my violin students (children and adults) begin at number 60 on the dial. If the time signature says 4/4, each quarter note receives one beat and there are 4 beats per measure. They practice scales, exercises and all songs at 60 to begin with. Once they master everything at 60 they move the dial to a higher number. The following numbers are 63, 66, 69, 72, 76, 80, etc. (all the way to 208 on this metronome) Their goal is to play at 80 with no mistakes. Many students can play well at numbers higher than 80."

It did take a little while to break in the special 20 before it played as easy and sweet as it's step brother- the American Ace. It has a more contained, refined sound than the other two I mentioned and bends well. I still find my American Ace bends easier but it's probably 10 years old and the reeds are weaker than my brand new Special 20. I am still curious about the Lee Oskars but for the history of Hohner, the average $7.00 cheaper than Lee Oskars, and the fact it is made in Germany, I opted for the Special 20. Awesome harmonica at an awesome price. They also have a short waranty unlike other brands."

Like others, I found installing the battery was annoying.  It's easier if you focus on pushing one side tab at a time.  
The directions are not helpful for someone unfamiliar with tuners.  Pressing the Pitch button raises the Hz.  My teacher prefers Hz 441 vs 440, so I have been able to use that setting.

If you're looking for picks to play guitar with, celluloid is worthless. They're fragile, and the surface is far too slick if your hands sweat at all. Try Tortex or Delrins. Tortex is the business, in my experience. 

I should note that every one of the guitar picks mentioned in this review is fully compatible with all major operating systems except for CPM/80 and the old Incompatible Time-Sharing System from MIT, except for the Delrins, which create a sort of Tesla-coil effect when used with one's-complement integer systems.

In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement."

Trinen ""trinen""","Seattle, WA United States","For years I used Rat distortion boxes for guitar and for bass. Now I play bass a lot more in bands, and find the Rat sound to be weak and one dimensional. I sold off my rat and tried out a number of other distortion boxes at a local shop and settled on the Big Muff Pi. This thing is rich. The complexity of the distortion is incredible compared to what you get with most other pedals--must be the brilliant Russian engineering behind it. It has three knobs: Volume, Sustain, and Tone. The Volume is obvious, the sustain is really the distortion level. For the Bass, I run the sustain very low, and the volume higher and get a great mix of clean and distorted tone. Sometimes I run the sustain knob turned all the way off and this thing still drives the sound nicely. Too much distortion on the bass and you loose your ability to cut through the rest of the band in my opinion. The Tone knob adjusts the center frequency of the distortion. I run mine way over to the left and distort the low end around 200-400 kHz. You can crank it around and get anything from a low grumbly distortion tall the way to a really tinny irritating heavy metal sound. This thing is versatile, and no matter how you like your settings, the distortion it produces is rich in harmonic overtones, multi-dimensional, and unlike any other boxes I've tried. Highly recommended.
My only complaint is that this box is designed to work only on battery power--no AC adapter at all. Fortunately now there's an adapter from One-Spot that can be connected to a battery lead and then to an AC adapter. Hopefully Amazon will start carrying that soon."

The sound I get from this overdrive pedal is much more than I thought I'd get for my starter collection.

The casing is a heavy duty plastic, not metal so I'm not sure how well it would hold up to stage use or someone with a heavy foot. 

As for the comment about this pedal being a waste of time by another reviewer, most guitarists already know that they need to purchase an AC adaptor for a power source. Consider it a learning experience. Once you buy the adapter be sure to pick up a multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal. This allows you to hook up several more plugs to the one AC adaptor. I now have 5 effects pedals hooked up to one energy source. Bought mine at The Guitar Center so I don't know if Amazon carries them.

Very smooth response, these cans are better than any of the source components I own. They are almost perfect for travel, though I'll probably end up purchasing a set of their cans for the iPod--the drivers are the same as the ones in this model, or so I've been told. These pull instruments out of a recording, and their ability to image instruments spatially is only matched by the clarity that they bring to vocals by Azam Ali of Niyaz or early recordings by Joan Baez. 

About the only improvement Grado could make would be improving the headband to can connection--it is held in place by a straight piece of wire, and the left can has come undone from the headband. More comfortable foam would be nice too, as long as it didn't compromise the sound quality."

Moreta,New York,"I purchased these about 1 month ago and used the ""burn in"" method of leaving my Grado running music for 6 days straight to open up the components in the headphones for good sound and was VERY impressed. I do have to say that they are a bit uncomfortable at first but its worth it for the good sound and the fact that the pads adjust and soften up after a while. It's also no where near as painful as my ordeal with my first pair of canalphones which were the E2c's(see my other reviews).

Anyways...on the subject of sound I have to say that its an all around winner with its smooth but punchy bass and its open soundstage which I guess results from the open ear design they have, and although some don't like the retro look of these phones I've really been gettin into them as of late, another big plus are the rotating cups and the thick cable which guarantee's a long life for these cans. I also gotta give Grado credit on it's expandability with amps and different cups which will leave me hunting  for new components seeing as I'm merely just a budding audiophile with a long way to go and a limited budget that wont let me upgrade my setup whenever I want(cries)...

P.S.

If you use these with your computer and there are pops and hisses its because the Grado are too good for the card which resulted in me buying a new 24bit external sound card from creative that gave me a REAL boost in sound quality. So overall these are a good pair of cans for someone who loves their music but just can't afford to buy the latest and greatest in the world of sound"

I got this little one for my son, who is 5, and didnt want to spend much because you know how children can be when it comes to lessons and instruments. I was very surprised at the quality of the sound. It is still in it's breaking in period, so the strings are still stretching, but it sounds really, really, nice. I even played on it myself (you know, just to get it warmed up for my son!) and it truly is not bad. Doesnt sound ""tinny"" or ""toyish"". Sounds like a classical guitar. Now I bought a much more expensive one a few years ago for my daughter, who has since given up the guitar, and that was handmade in mexico, solid wood, 3/4 size, and didn't sound nearly as good as this little thing. For this price, you get a solid spruce top, the finish is nice, kind of matted, the tuners are pretty good, and so far the strings aren't too bad. The base strings look like they could be silver-plated. Unfortunately you dont get any product information in the box so who knows where the strings came from and what kind they are (the guitar is romanian), but the main thing is that the guitar sounds so nice that a child will be encouraged to continue, the teacher will be pleased, and the parents will not have to suffer from more than the usual beginning-any-instrument ""noises"", and perhaps a lot less because it has such a pleasant sound.  Now of course it isnt comparable to the almansa or to finer guitars, but for a young child who is serious about wanting to study classical guitar, this is a very fine instrument at an EXCELLENT price. This model is sold on other sites for about 20 dollars more, but why pay that?! If you are looking for a small guitar for your young child, this one is a very good bet.

It is true that Grado cans are supraural (on the ear) as opposed to circumaural (around the ear) so you will feel the unit against your ears.  These cushions were redesigned back in 1998, offering greater thickness and distance from the transducer so that you feel more comfortable while listening through your cans AND the design allows for a greater soundstage for the magnificent Grado cans to impress you with.  These cushions, called ""L-Cush"" here, can be used on every single pair of current Grado cans except perhaps the $1000 set.  I use them on my SR60's, which come with a standard foam cushion that covers the whole transducer and it made them sound quite nearly as good as the SR80's!  I recommend them to you wholeheartedly!

Reasonable price and the instrument store shipped in good time.

Easy to use with either the lights or the needle. The guitars sounded great.
As others have said:
It's a little difficult to use the needle in a dark setting but the red/green lights are accurate.
A simple flip out stand would be a big help. Plugging in a cord jack makes it very awkward to position. That being said the idea of putting a groove on the back of the thing so you can insert a credit, business or playing card to lean it against is both odd and better than nothing.

They are accurate and inexpensive.  They work easily.

  This is the only real guitar tuner that I like. I have other guitar tuners that are pretty good that are not really guitar tuners but chromatic tuners with guitar settings. This is small accurate and sturdy and fits easily inside your shirt pocket or inside the small compartments in a guitar case. 

   It does have features for other settings which are great for alternate tunings.

    Don't be fooled by the Intellitouch and other strap ons. You can't figure out all their arrows as well as the dial on Korgs and others. They are too much trouble to use especially is you are doing precision work like setting up an adjustable bridge.

     The only thing is that they can be a bit unreliable if the a battery gets worn down. I usually check in new batteries every time I am going out to play some place serious.

I've owned several guitars and this one sounds just as good as any of the other popular brands.  It's easy to tune and hold its tune just right.  The proportions are nice, too, and fits nicely with my small hands.  I'd recommend this to anyone, especially anyone looking to learn and practice.  The black color looks great, too.

I have played bass recreationally for about 17 years, and occasionally strummed a guitar here and there.  I currently own a classical guitar I've had for 10 years, and sold my steel-string guitars several years ago.  I wanted this to replace the steel stringed ones, and to take camping, when I didn't want to take the fairly nice classical guitar and risk its damage.  When I opened the box, I was astounded to find a guitar with a very fine black finish, action almost perfect, and actually nearly in tune.  It looks great and sounds very good.  The sealed tuners are very smooth and have kept the guitar in tune thusfar.  The only flaws I could see were a small bit of glue where the fretboard met the top, just at the soundhole, and a very slight overlap of some of the binding glue onto the body, maybe 0.2mm x 1mm, only noticable when looking for it.  Soundwise, it sounds very good, especially considering the cost.   It sounds especially good with a pick.  The treble side of the guitar is bright and clear.  The bass side of it is a little thin, and the low 'E' is fairly dull when fingerpicking.  I am hoping that changing the stock strings might help it a little.  It's passable, just not great.  The frets are very good, and smooth.  The ends are nicely rounded.  I had expected to need to polish the frets, but at this point will leave them as-is.  To sum it up, I think this guitar is a complete steal for the price if you are a beginner looking to start, or if you want a spare guitar to keep at the lakehouse or to take camping.  It plays very good and looks even better.  Like I said, I had intended to take this one camping, but it's almost too nice for that"

You must attach headphones (supplied) or your own amp/speakers.

Also, it comes in either brown, green, or yellow AT RANDOM, and is meant to clip on your belt/pants. It's not built like a brick so don't step on it.

Also, in the negative column, I found the distortion sound unpleasant when I cranked it to 11. However, setting the level to halfway or 2/3 of the way up produced an acceptable distorted sound. (I don't have a lot of experience with other cheap amps, though, so the Danelectro might not be the worst thing out there.)

In the positive column, the clean sound was good, there was no hum, only a small amount of hiss, and the reverb was mild but pleasant. (There's no control over reverb level or speed, only an on/off button.) There's plenty of power to drive the supplied headphones at ""loud enough to hurt your ears.)

Grand total: 3 buttons (Power, Distortion on/off, Reverb on/off); 2 dials (volume control, distortion level); 3 jacks (guitar in, headphone out, line out); one LED.

Bottom line: if you don't have a headphone practice amp already, getting one at the current low price is a no-brainer"

The unit has a distortion effect and an echo effect. I love the quality of the echo effect so much, that I have actually used it on stage a few times in place of my (much more expensive) Rocktron Short timer Digital Delay. As others have mentioned, I replaced the headset with a quality (but not expensive) Sony set. But, at this price, it's hard to believe they include a headphone set of any kind! Don't listen to those who criticize its potential for ""live"" or ""one-stage"" use. IT'S NOT MEANT FOR THAT! If you use this to practice or to entertain yourself, without interfering with other people in the room, you are going to be thrilled. I also lay down chord tracks, on an inexpensive cassette recorder, and practice playing lead. If anything happens to this little amp, I will quickly replace it. I have encouraged all of my electric guitar students to purchase one, and I'll be giving them as gifts to friends who play. At less than $20.00, the Danelectro e-studio 15, is a tremendous bargain.

I own six of their effects pedals in addition to this amp. They make excellent products for what they charge and I've been impressed with almost everything I've bought from them. 
On to the headphone amp - First off you might as well throw out the headphones it comes with, they're crap. But that's to be expected I guess. That aside, everything else performs very well. It's definitely loud enough, the distortion is good, however it is pretty fuzzy and gets noisy at higher volumes. The echo on this thing, (which is the main reason I decided to get this instead of a Rockman) is awesome. It sounds exactly like my classic slap echo pedal. It's very clear and stays consistent with the distortion on or off and at higher volumes.
I like the line out option but I haven't tried it yet. It's a cool idea though. It is smaller than I thought it was going to be which was a pleasant surprise. It's about the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe a little bigger. Definately small enough to keep in your pocket. It's also very lightweight. 
My only real complaint is the retarded sea foam green color, and cheesy fake chrome but who cares, no one ever sees it anyway.

Overall I'd definately reccomend this amp to anyone looking for a mini headphone amp (...). The Dean headphone amp looks like it could be decent but it doesnt come with echo and it's hard to find."

I have only played with two teams and I am going to have to say that the estimated time of game play for teams is off.  Whenever I played, it took at least three hours to finish, and less if we decided not to finish.  The hardest part is getting the industry awards.  The game always ended with both teams going for their last award, so that kept it close . . . which is cool, but it is the main reason the game takes so long.

Also, the board design seemed to make it so that we would land on ""On the Map"" and ""Music Mix"" more than any other space.  Most of the questions are pretty hard, especially ""50's"".  It was one of the funniest moments during the game when my opposing team was relieved to know they were to get a Britney Spears question.  The relief turned into frustration when the question asked for one of the producers of her album, and it was not the one that they knew.  It was awesome.

Overall it's a good game.  It just takes a while to finish (especially with the difficulty of the industry awards), I hate landing on the ""50's"" square, and it seems to get like some bands more than others (like the Band).

I bought this mic and found that it was way too sensitive/hot for consumer cameras like a Panasonic gs200 which has no audio input level control. It picks up too much background noise and overwhelms the camera's automatic gain controller when things get loud. I'm not sure if the gs200 had a mic attenuation setting or if turning it on would have been a sufficient answer. I put a cheap radio shack in-line volume controller in between the mic and the camera (which can introduce crackle if you adjust it while recording).

On prosumer cams with input level control like the Canon GL2 it works fine, even without turning on mic attenuation. If you have a camcorder with input level controls I might get this.

Another important caveat: You cannot run this mic through a the 1/8"" connection of a Beachtek mixer box. You'll hear nothing on the beachtek's output because of an impedance mismatch. I don't know if putting an XLR adapter on the mic cable would work"

The mount is attached to the mic so this is the only way you can use it and it is made to mount to the standard ""shoe"" that is on nearly all camcorders.

So why should you be?  After all, there is no pick that will make you play better and they are all generally the same.

WRONG.  I thought that too at first.  I figured it's just a piece of plastic, how hard can it be to pick one?  I started out with fender pick because they looked pretty conventional and they were moderately priced.  I blindly went through about ten of these due to them all breaking.

If you knew me well you'd know that I thrash my guitar...a lot...  Even the thickest picks would wear down on me within a week, and most of them were too slick to stay in my sweaty hand during these crash and burn guitar playing moments.  I came to realize that I needed a heavy duty pick with a good grip that would retain it's shape for at least a couple of weeks.  

At first I thought metal was the answer.  I mean, it's hard as rock and most of them come with a good grip on them.  But after playing with them I discovered the sound was not to my liking.  It sounded too buzzy with metal.  That's about the time I discovered tortex picks.  I was amazed.  They had the best grip I have ever felt and kept their shape for weeks!  I instantly bought every size I could get all the way from the thinnest read to the bulky blue one.

Months later I'm keeping a stock of these picks in my house.  For solos I prefer the green one because it's got just the right resistance for that fast picking but not too much so that it slows you down.  For strumming I use the orange.  It's just perfect...

I cannot express to you how much you need to try this pick.  Your wasting your money on anything other than Dunlop.  Get the tortex and see what I mean"

Now as for the key of C...  I get a lot more use out of the keys of A and E, but thats another story.."

The Jellifish changes a lot the texture of the pluck when you strum or do arpeggios but it's a little fragile.

I like it so that I play with it a lot of time since I bought it but I have a strong strumming stile so the tires, the largest ones, are breaking from the root. This is not a flaw of the Jellifish, they are very clear about that to produce the sounds they say it's better to do it by light strum and picking. It's just that I get emotional when I play, jajaja.

I also founded a way to use it as a physical cello bow. Note this pick is for textures cause it not produces an effect like a pedal.

It's a smart product that could bring some new life in your playing, but only if you're open minded and don't expect a pick and neither a pedal effect kind of sound. 

I only want I always have a new one available, they have a 6 month lifetime I read somewhere in the jellifish page."

I love innovative musical tools, and the Jellifish delivers. I am a guitar instructor and teach over 50 students a week from beginner to very advanced. I have had all of my students purchase the Jellifish because in order to get the Chorus! Pluck! and Bow! sounds you must master 3 picking styles that every guitarist should know how to use regardless. Specifically, a fluid, sweep picking technique will produce a lush chorusing effect that is a cross somewhere between a 12-string and a chorus pedal. Alternate picking, when done properly from the wrist, will produce the Pluck! effect, which somewhat sounds like a hammered dulcimer. And circular picking -- done from the thumb and forefinger -- will obtain a bowed effect that is very nice on slower, scalar patterns, but can also be used on arpeggios. 100 years from now, the Jellifish won't be novel, because every guitarist will use this the same as they do capos and slides. Minimal proficiency with this device is de rigueur for any serious student of the instrument"

Pifer ""Techie""","Traverse City, MI","I have found the many of the same things to be true as the previous reviewer.  If you want a brighter Elixir, they also make NanoWeb versions with a lighter coating.  They do wear out quicker though.

Before I started using Elixirs, my favorite strings were D' Addario 80/20 Phosphor Bronze.  I could get 3 sets for the price of 1 set of Elixirs.  I really found the Elixir's price to be a bit of a shock, but used them for a few months.  On a whim, I went back to the other strings.  I never noticed how quickly they oxidized and went dead before!  I've gone back and stayed with Elixir.

I've also tried the D' Addario EXP and Dean Markley Alchemy coated strings.  They were okay, but I found the Elixirs looked and sounded better longer.

Downsides? The uncoated strings show wear spots and oxidize long before the coated ones.  Also, as the coating wears off, I've found the strings get ""fuzzy.""  Overall, I still end up changing stings a lot less than I used to.  One star deducted for the high price."

From experimenting over the years, I've found that, while I have ""old standbys"" that will be the first thing I try, often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar.

Coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years.  They're expensive, but they last a lot longer, especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly.  Also, they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings.

Elixir Polywebs were the first coated string.  The coating is much heavier than that of other strings.  This produces a much less bright, more muted sound.  I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I can't stand it with standard strings.  The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where it's perfect.

If you're looking for a darker sound, then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot.  If you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings, then you definitely don't want Polywebs.

The 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound.  If you don't want this sound, you could end up awarding them 1 star"

These were the strings I settled on after all that experimentation and I have never looked back. Slinky 9's are ALL I have bought for the past nine years. There are two types of electric guitar strings: Expensive and cheap. NEVER buy cheap strings. They sound too bright and about one out of twenty will break when you wind them up. Expensive strings are a little more complicated. The durability factor is much better with expensive strings. About one out of eighty will break. The difference between the expensive brands is in the sound. Some are ""tinny"" or bright. Some sound like bass strings tuned way up. With that said, Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9's have what I call a ""V"" voicing. It's like they have a little equalizer built in set to a good rock setting. You know, boost the mids and highs and roll back the mids. THESE... are the only strings designed specifically for rock/metal/southern rock/progressive heavier jam bands/etc. Period.

Boss is known for their great sounding effects and rugged construction of their products, this one is no different.  The distortion from this pedal is simple, very smooth, and very versatile.  It's not too noisy, allowing single notes played to be heard with clarity.  If you'd like to hear it, you can probably find some sound clips of it being used on Boss's website"

Henderson,"Buffalo, NY","Our son wanted a drum set for his 15th birthday.  Seeings he is totally new to this we didn't want to pay a huge sum for a set only to have him lose interest.  This set is great for beginners and he's very happy with it.

To people considering purchasing this, please note that the cymbals ARE NOT included with this set even though they are in the picture.  Perhaps the company should consider posting another photos sans the cymbals"

In addition, the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. DAVA is the only brand of picks I use and each type suits my every need. I whole heartedly recommend them to anyone."
