B000931OAI:crappy_paper:d._margolis,B000931OAI,"Moleskine Small Plain Notebook - The Legendary Notebook of Hemingway, Picasso, and Chatwin - Moleskin Blank Book Journal Designed in Italy: Office Products",office products,4 of 8,2.0,Crappy Paper,"April 20, 2006",D. Margolis,,"I bought a small one of these with blank, unlined pages as a pocket sketchbook. The pocket sketchbooks commonly sold in art supply stores are one of two varieties, either wire-bound or stitched. The thing is, wire-bound notebooks are uncomfortable to have in a back pocket (and I just don't like the feel, bumping up against the ridges of the wires on that edge), and most stitched bindings don't fold as well as the Moleskine does (folding nice and wide so there's plenty of blank page to use). 

And to be honest, I may've fallen just a little for that pompous tripe about being the sketchbook of great artists. 

The thing is, the paper is terrible. All the 'bloggers and geeks I've heard raving about these notebooks use them for their laundry lists or their ideas to write about or God knows what. And while I'm not the best artist around, I did minor in fine arts in school, so I'm not completely clueless. So take my word (or don't; it's your loss); the paper is just plain bad. 

Most drawing paper has some degree of ""tooth""--the roughness of the paper, which rubs off your graphite or charcoal smoothly onto the page. The tooth on these sketchbooks is nonexistent. Rather than describe in more detail the paper, however, I believe I can give an apt description in two words. 

Manila folder. That's what the paper in these books is like, so as to be nearly indistinguishable (slightly smoother, in fact, than manila folders--even less tooth). While paper quality is something of a personal preference, I've never seen anyone use any paper remotely similar to this for drawing, so I have to question the claim that these pads are identical to those used by Picasso et al. 

On a positive note, the binding is great, the covers are great, and the elastic strap, bookmark ribbon, and back pocket are all great features. But when it comes down to it, I care most about the paper quality. If you want to just write, get one of these. If you intend to do any serious drawing, don't bother."

But I wouldn't be surprised to discover that the rest of the stuff they make is ALSO junk.

This stuff is EXPENSIVE....over $15 for five sheets from Office Depot.
I had put in a brand new ink cartridge just a couple of days prior (HP PSC 1410 Inkjet)  and it was working fine on normal paper. Read all the directions carefully and more than once. First time, the paper CUT OFF the top portion of the image.....sure, blame it on the printer; but if so, why didn't normal paper do this? Second time, it printed really wimpy and hazy grey....yet I had set the printer to use MAXIMUM dpi! I thought, ""OK, maybe it will darken from the heat of the iron. Set the kitchen timer, ironed it exactly as instructed....and it is STILL a sickening hazy grey instead of the crisp black I wanted! AND some of the darkness of the fabric below is showing through the white portions.
Oh yes...it is INCREDIBLY difficult to peel off the backing...you do end up having to tear a portion of the design you create, pretty much ruining it.
 So....wasted time shopping for this. Overpaid for the product. Wasted HOURS prepping the image. And now I have a ruined tote bag that can't be replaced. Avery scum, I HATE YOU"

The problem is that there are no assembly instructions, just a few pictures, and the design is faulty for assembly. For instance, the hardware can attach the wrong way to the bottom of the smaller shelf when it would have been easy to design it so that the hardware can only go on one way; it took 90 minutes to assemble by 2 skilled men because the pole for each shelf didn't fit well into the mainframe poles (we had to use soap and three people holding and pushing), and the stand had some gashes in it though it was advertised as new. Changing the height of this stand takes 2 people because at first it won't move, and then it falls and hits your knee. Now that it's together, we're using it, but what a price"

The nickel and dime ones were so tight that after I filled the sleeves--a lot of unfolding, smoothing, trying again--they couldn't easily be slipped out. If you can see coins bouncing on my kitchen table and rolling hither and yon, with me down on my hands and knees swallowing expletives, you've got the picture. The only mold that wasn't defective was the quarter size, and as this is the one that takes fewer coins than all the rest to fill up, it is the least valuable in terms of time-saving. I waited at least a month after buying these before I sat down to roll all my coins so I didn't feel good about asking for my money back, which is why I cannot share anything about this company's return policy that might help you decide whether or not to give them a try as it's possible I was simply unlucky and got sent a set of molds from a bad batch"

Lee,"fremont, ca","Throughout the years I have used and owned many different versions of the Brita Pitcher Water Dispenser. All of these filtered water containers have been great. The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size. The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products.

Pro:

Size: This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (Ironically, this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.)

Con(s):

Mold: If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days, you will get mold. This mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). To avoid this problem, the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to safe you should wash it more often). I have never had this problem with Brita's other products (I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months, and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it).

Left Over Water: Due to the faulty design of the product, there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. Besides turning the product upside down, you cannot dispense all of the water. This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. Not surprisingly, this helps further contribute to mold growth.

Conclusion:

Save your money and buy Brita's other well designed pitchers or even Pure's pitchers. (The key word is pitcher.) You will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product"

However, because I liked the pen so much and used it every chance I got, within 3 weeks, the ink cartridge was empty. That's when my love of the pen began to falter.
I opened the pen, according to the package instructions, and removed the ink cartridge. However, it never worked the same again. The twist and click feature failed to hold the pen in the advanced position, so whenever I would bear down to write, it would retract and push up into the pen again. 
So, I bought another, thinking I must have done something wrong. Carefully, after the ink ran out in 2 weeks this time (guess I did more writing), I changed the cartridge again. Same thing. At a high price tag ($8-9) for a plastic pen, I bought a third and gave it one more try. Same luck. 
So, while I loved the feel and flow of the pen, it is certainly not worth the price tag for a pen whose mechanisms,  housing and construction will only last a month. 
Won't buy another one. Three times and you're out."

I sharpened about ten pencils with the first one (excellent sharpening while it lasted), and something ""let go"" inside. The motor ran but the rotating blade had no more power - as soon as I pressed the pencil into the blade it would stop turning while the motor continued running freely.

I unwrapped the second sharpener to see if it would hold up better. Again, after about 10 pencils, exactly the same thing happened.

When I disassembled one of them to analyze the failure, I discovered that a crucial area of the plastic gear that drives the blade mechanism was stripped away so that the gear was spinning practically freely. It was unable to drive the blade mechanism with any significant strength.

Conclusion: This product is potentially an excellent pencil sharpener but it has a major design weakness in its drive train. I only put one star on this review because zero stars is not available"

The more fingers that fall off, the faster paper backs up and gets jammed. So after every 10-15 pages I have to get out a pair of needlenose pliers and pull the impacted paper out of these tiny slots. It takes about 10 minutes of extreme frustration to unclog this clunker. That's about a minute a page. This is obviously completely unacceptable because if I had enough time to spend 1 minute to shred each piece of paper I would be paper mache artist.

Rogers,"Seattle, Washington","I first encountered Moleskine notebooks in a bookstore in London this spring, and what lodged in my memory was their marketing claim to be ""the legendary notebook of Hemingway,"" et cetera. I have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. But now that I own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it, I'm beginning to see, at least, why Moleskine notebooks have so many fans.

For more than ten years, I've used a calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system that isn't just a notebook but has an entire philosophy about how you're supposed to live your life tied into it. I never bought into that aspect of the company, but have grown used to having one reference containing all that stuff between two covers, and with a place for a pen besides. Going from that to a Moleskine, with its one small pocket in the back and no place to put a writing instrument, is definitely a switch. It's the part of the change I'm least sure about. On the other hand, the Moleskine definitely wins for portability, ease of use, style, and handiness-to-have-around in case of brainstorms.

So I'm still not completely sold that this is the best of all possible notebooks. But it's definitely a good one, and I do appreciate both the attractiveness of the design and the quality of the construction. Sure, you can get a serviceable notebook for about a tenth of the price, and a whole ""lifestyle system,"" updated annually, for quite a bit more. It's all a matter of taste, and my taste is starting to run in this direction"

Queirolo,,"I beat the hell out of everything I own. My PDA which this has partially replaced has an aluminum hardshell case and a metal body. I have broken just every watch I have ever owned (and I have/had a few excellent watches). I am naturally hard on things due to my focus on life not on my gear. This little notebook has kept itself together so far, while looking very hip. 

I am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options, this is just faster, lighter and thinner than my PDA for scribbling notes. I am never without it in the office. 

The back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when I first bought it. However, I use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive).

I like the construction and archival quality of the book. My notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (I am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if I ever have to refer back to them I can be assured that they will be there for a long time. 

It only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate, I will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. Just get your company to pay for it if you can, because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while.

Lastly: For the person who likes their Montblanc notebook with tear out pages, they are partially missing the point. These books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes. I also highly doubt that their notebook is as thin as one of these is either. Each have their own place"

As a student of book making, this is a classic piece. Most books nowadays are a form of ""perfect binding"" where the pages are just glued on the spine. Needless to say this is as non-archival and non-durable as it gets. Moleskine's are done they classic way: pages folded and sewn together in signatures then sewn to the binding. They will last forever, which is why we still have sketchbooks around from the likes of Van Gogh, etc.

An overall great choice, I recommend it constantly"

A moleskine usually lasts me about a year -- that's a year of grocery lists, ideas, business plans, sketches of where the furniture ought to be, phone numbers, recipes, all the things I might have written on scraps of paper and lost if it weren't for my moleskine.  Who needs a Blackberry?

This notebook is sturdy, with pages sewn (rather than glued), so they don't fall out.  The paper is good quality, a pleasure to write on.  There's a ribbon to keep your place, and an elastic to keep the notebook shut while it's bashing around your bag or pocket.  There's even a clever little accordion-pleated pocket in the back for receipts or ticket stubs or other small paper treasures.

Moleskines come lined and blank as well as squared, but the squared is best for my purposes -- and you'll be amazed how many uses you find for graph paper once you have it"

I suppose that those people who still care enough about the physical writing experience of pen to paper might be more inclined to romanticize it (in other words, not only great notebooks, see below, but also smart marketing, and more power to them). I also enjoy writing, but with respect to the little 3.5"" x 5"" books, on a purely practical level, I like these simply because there are very few notebooks out there that provide such a high quality writing experience in such a small volume of space. The little (3.5"" x 5"") softcover is almost ideal for shoving in your back pocket and carrying everywhere, with  nice, high quality paper. The covers are durable and smooth enough to still work well even after acquiring some ""character"" in your back pocket (ie they actually mold to your [...] a bit!).  I haven't tried a fountain pen in it; although I enjoy writing with them, I wouldn't use one in this application anyway. These little books are not really for writing the Great American Novel (or the Great Novel of Your Country of Origin), they're more for jotting notes or to-do lists, and they work extremely well in this role. The only reason I withhold one star is the lack of a feature that would make them completely perfect for me; a pen attachment/enclosure provision. My ideal book would be able to accomodate a thin pen in the spine, so that the book could be slid into my pocket easily with no fear of snagging or worry about whether I remembered to ""click"" the pen to retract it.  I realize this would make it a bit bulkier, though. As it is, my leading pen choices for this are the Fisher Space pen or the Zebra G-301 medium point gel retractable, the former being very, very short (but a bit thicker) when capped, and the latter being very nice and skinny, but longer.  Anyway, these notebooks are a pleasure to use, and though a bit costly, for how long they last me and the pleasure (and utter utility) I get from using them, they seem like a ""reasonable extravagance"" to me. I'll go through many, many of these before I spend what I would on the cheapest PDA"

These journals are truly something special.  With the nice, firm cover; lots of pages; a pocket; and elastic to keep them shut, they offer a ton of function for compulsive scribblers.

But...they demand a little flexibility from the journalist in return.  They don't handle all inks well, and in particular they handle very few fountain pen inks without significant bleed-through.

So if one commits to a Moleskine journal, one commits to a pen/ink combination that won't bleed--opening up both sides of the paper--or one resigns oneself to wasting the back half of each page.

For those willing to do a little research, though, the pen/ink combinations are out there (fountain pen users should look up Noodler's Black; for Gel roller users, Pilot's G2 refills also work splendidly with Moleskine).  

If you want a solid, utilitarian journal, it's tough to beat these, especially at a reasonable price--but the bleeding pages will require adjustments.  It's up to you"

Buck artist's model and I was very, very happy with it. It was an enormous improvement on the old wooden models I grew up with. It is detailed in a way that the old wooden mannequins never were and it is flexible enough to put into an accurate, full-lotus position complete with the detail of having the backs of the feet resting on the thighs, and that,  is scary bendy. The only problem with it is that the neck joint, although providing a good range of motion, is very delicate and broke not long after I bought it. 

Now, this is not the end of the world if you have the right tools. I used a Dremel moto-tool to cut out the remnant of the original joint and to grind the head off of a narrow nail which I then heated holding it with a pair of pliers and inserted into the upper torso to make a hole and then into the bottom of the neck: problem solved. The end result is still just as flexible as when  it came out of the box with the exception of the neck's motion being limited to rotation from side to side.

Apparently, this flaw is known to sideshow toys who released a new, second version of the model in two sexes and three colors. The new series has a caucasian female figure that is not *quite* as flexible as the original--among other things, the detailed full-lotus is pretty much out of the question--and it is more ""voluptous"", having larger breasts, a heavier body, broader thighs and a much stronger neck. Also, both mannequins have heads that seem just slightly out of proportion with the body... just slightly larger than they should be.

Be all that as it may, the original gray pictured in the above listing and offered at a ten percent discount under list is the real thing: skinnier and far more flexible than the current model but having a flaw which makes it something of a compromise; making you choose between the genuinely superior flexibility of the original mannequin (which you may eventually have to repair) or seeking out the newer model which exchanges flexibility for sturdiness while adding features that can be summed up by the term ""sex-appeal.""

I have both models and after performing the necessary repair, I prefer the original gray and highly recommend it with the caveat that you must be very careful while handling it unless you are willing to and able to perform a fairly easy repair. 

I could perform it and I did which is why I rate this item as highly as I do: all in all, you can call the original gray an excellent product with a small, repairable flaw. Your mileage may vary"

Rogers,"Seattle, Washington","I discovered Moleskine notebooks in London about two months ago and bought my first, a Small Ruled Notebook, about one month ago. It's not taken me long to become a convert to these little gems, since I've now bought my second Moleskine, the small address book.

The address book wasn't entirely what I was expecting, but that's a good thing. It is almost identical to the small ruled notebook, except for alphabetized tabs along the page edges. Unlike most address books, there are no neat boxes to fill in with names, street addresses, and city/state/ZIP; no separate spaces for home, work, and cell numbers. There are only ... lines.

What this means, of course, is that you can record whatever information you choose to, however you choose to. A person can be tucked into one line, or have an entire page for herself. Moleskine makes a big deal about its notebooks being tools for the self-expression of the people who use them, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this philosophy extends even into the usually-mundane world of the address book. I didn't expect to have such a positive reaction to this product, but that's what happened"

Blackwelder ""fountain pen daily user""",,"I write with Noodler's Black (the brand's ""standard"" black ink) almost every day because I can't always choose the paper to write on. Noodler's Black can be used for two-sided writing on bad paper, even newsprint, which is rare among all the fountain pen inks in the world.

I also write with Noodler's Black because it's waterproof, forgery-proof, good-looking, and pleasantly smooth during writing. I confidently write checks with Noodler's Black, and it is safe for signing valuable or important documents too (when black is an acceptable color; ask your lawyer).

Please keep in mind that the Noodler's company carefully says which of the brand's colors are waterproof and which are not. In my experience Noodler's Black is by far the best Noodler's color for writing on both sides of bad paper.

One behavior you might notice, if your pen's nib is an exposed metal surface (not covered with colored enamel), is that Noodler's (standard) Black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces. This ""nib creep"" is harmless behavior because the ink doesn't run down onto the grip area. Wiping the ink off the nib is only temporary; more ink will soon spread to replace what you wiped off. Again, this is harmless behavior and a very small price to pay for the security of your marks, signatures and important handwritten texts"

However, I got to the point where I was needing to check my calendar while I was out, so on a recommendation from a friend I got the Moleskine calendar.  It has proved even more useful than I thought.  After I forgot to return a library book on time for about the third time, a friend who had heard me gush about my calendar suggested that I simply write the due date inside.  I've come to the point where I am keeping track of my life in this book, and it is a life saver.

Many other calendars are bulky.  I love the slim line and clean design of the Moleskine.  It is top quality, but not pretentious.  I could not recommend it more"

Moleskine makes great products. The planner is well-constructed and will survive a year of heavy use with ease. The small size makes it ideal for a purse or briefcase.  The hardcover adds protection and the pockets add functionality. The are perfect for slipping in a phone number or business card to keep handy.

But using heavy paper for daily printing is not really environmental friendly. That's why i prefer light weight ones. I had tried 20lbs too, but really believe me, if you have an injet printer, you wouldn't want to print on a 20 lb paper. That's why 24lbs is the optimum, at least for me"

The barrel of this pen is all stainless steel, which looks nice but feels slippery as you're trying to write.  Parker makes the same pen with a plastic barrel, which is easier to grip but looks less sleek.  In other words, there is a tradeoff between looks and functionality, in my opinion.  This is an excellent pen in every other way, with solid build quality, sturdy clip, and confident push-button mechanism.  Parker's ballpoint refill, which was reformulated sometime around 2002, is the best I've used, beating Montblanc, Pelikan, Cross, PaperMate, and BIC ballpoint refills in terms of smoothness, consistency, and smudge resistance.  For me, this pen (with plastic barrel) is the ideal ballpoint for everyday, all-purpose use."

I was first attracted by the Stainless Ballpoint's classic stylish looks.  (I prefer the gold click & clip model, but have also used the complete silver model with pleasure.)    

Until my discovery of Parkers I had used Pilots, Papermates, Shaffers, and Crosses with varying degrees of success. (I left Cross pens due to their excessive costs. Shaffers easily brake.  Pilot and Papermate inks soon fade to invisibility!)  I have been using, and recommending, Parkers ever since.

Parker's Stainless Ballpoint is sturdy and durable.  I have used them to print, of course, and to point, pry, and pound.  Never have I permanently damaged one.  (With excessive torque Parker Stainless pens will bend.  I have re-straightened Parkers with vice grips.)  Parker Stainless Ballpoints are rugged and take considerable abuse and keep on working.  (Once, the internal plastic clicker malfunctioned, for the only mishap I've ever experienced with a Parker.)

I also like Parker's ink formula.  I began my career with blue medium and later moved to black fine.  For the past 15 years I have used Parker's fine blue.  The refills cost between 10% and 50% less than the Cross pen refills (depending on the vendor).

Parker ink dries quickly (rarely leaving a smudge under left-handers).  It doesn't wobble (i.e. floating away from the point of application) as does some pithy contemporary inks.  Parker ink has brilliant color, is attractive, and easy to read.  

I've notice, over the years, that Parker ink does not fade. Twenty year old journal entries, tax records, and business notes are not faded to date.  (I've become curious about how long Parker ink will perform.)

I have given Parker Stainless Ballpoints as gifts, awarded them for achievement, and presented them with gratitude.  They are excellent gift candidates.  (Others have always been impressed with this pen's classic beauty and the Parker name.)

If you are in the market for a nice looking sturdy pen with ink that doesn't wobble or fade I suggest you try the Parker Stainless Ballpoint.  Amazon.com's price is excellent.  Get yours soon."

The price you pay for the pleasure of smooth writing is that now and then the ink will ball up on the pen tip and you have to ""roll"" it off onto some paper. I normally find some ink on my hands after using the new refills and the problem may be that I'm writing for so long and the pen has become warm. Even with this issue, the writing seems perfect and the ink is a soft sapphire, easy on the eyes and the pen writes like a dream. I'm writing out all my recipes with these refills and they look wonderful. Writing with a Cross pen always feels a little more luxurious and then pen has lasted for years.

Rogers,"Seattle, Washington","I try not to be too materialist a person, and am seldom afflicted with ""object lust."" But as a long-time Anglophile and newly-minted Moleskine addict, when I read about the then-forthcoming City Notebook series, and specifically the London edition, my initial reaction could be described as: ""waaaaaannnnt!""

After what seemed like a very long wait, this product finally showed up here, and I can say it fulfills all my expectations. It is not only to my mind the perfect medium for memorializing my sabbatical trip to the UK last spring, but it's also a great tool for collecting ideas for what to do on my (hopefully not-too-long-from-now) return trip. And it will be a most handy resource to have while I'm there. Before, during, after.

If that makes the Moleskine City Notebook sound like the Swiss Army knife of guidebooks, that is intentional. The idea that drives this notebook is captured in the quotation from Aldous Huxley's 1925 essay collection ""Along the Road"" that's printed on the Moleskine's second page: ""For any traveler who has any taste of his own, the only useful guide-book will be the one which he himself has written."" The London City Notebook contains a comprehensive set of maps (with index), followed by a bunch of blank pages and a section of tabbed pages with interesting icons. Perforated pages allow for handy notes and reminders, and there are also tracing pages ""for your itineraries and whatever."" The reliable Moleskine back pocket contains label stickers for creating your own tabbed sections, and to help you remember where you wrote things, there are three bookmark ribbons instead of the usual single one.

London and Moleskine have a special connection for me because it was in a fairly well-known legal and business bookstore on High Holborn where I saw a Moleskine display for the first time. I'm looking forward to filling this one with memories, notes, and references from that first trip and starting to put together thoughts for what to do the next time. As guidebooks go, I will definitely give ""the one which I myself have written"" pride of place on my travel bookshelf ... and if I make plans for Paris or Amsterdam, say, then their City Notebooks will show up there too"

Armed with that criteria, I looked at several ""utilitarian"" pens including the Waterman Phileas.  The reviews were about equal, but the ""Stealth Fighter"" looks of the Lamy won out in the end.

Does it write as smoothly as my Cross?  In a word: No...  However, it does lay down a nice line and doesn't ""scratch.""  I would compare the line to the Pilot V2 .07 Gel Pens I've been using lately.

I went to Office Depot's web site and staring me right in the face on their main page was a sale ad for this chair. Only $99 instead of the ususal $140, it said. $100 was about what I wanted to spend, and being a large indivdual, I thought it was serendipity. So I go to my local store the next day and they also have it marked for $99. I take a seat in their display model and instantly fall in love. It feels huge compared to my previous chair, a model by the same manufacturer, but cheaper and not as sturdy. I take the tag to the front to checkout, and decided to read the store's sale ad while I wait for a stocker to get my chair down from the back with a fork lift. I look in the ad just to see if my new chair is in it, but it's not. I was pleased to discover a note saying that I would recieve a $20 gift card with my $99 or up chair purcahse. Excellent, I though, but it got even better when the checker simply deducted the $20 from the purcahse price instead of giving me a gift card. So in short I was able to score this completely excellent and most comfortable chair for only $80!!! It's incredible, seriously. And the lumbar support is excellent.

It's beautiful, but after a couple years of wear and hours of sitting at the computer, my neck was killing me! Keep in mind that I have a relatively physical job lifting baggage 12 hours+ at the airport, so my body is aching when I get home. I needed a comfortable chair with a high-back to rest my weary neck.

I read some reviews of other chairs that say they were easy to assemble and in actuality were not.

(Keep with me, I'm going to sum-up to a raving review!)

I looked at a few chairs with massage features - vibrate & knead with embedded rolling balls. Well, I tried one of those chairs. The features are great, but the chairs are ultimately uncomfortable.

(Here it comes, I'm going to tie this all together.)

Not this chair! It is THE most comfortable chair I have EVER sat in! I wasn't sure what I was getting looking at a picture, so I went to Office Max. All their chairs sucked! I went to Office Depot and fell in love!

I can sleep in this chair! I can put my head back and play at the computer with a heating pad on my neck. It's roomy and oh sooooo comfortable! Words cannot express how much I love this Chair!

When I took it out of the box, I thought, ""this is going to be so hard to put together and the air lift wont work; it probably wont feel the same way it did in the store."" WRONG! I put it together in probably 5 minutes. The clean-up was harder - picking-up the bags and throwing away the box. Why? Because I could not get out of my new chair. Heck, I may just throw away my bed and sleep right here...well, if I could get up.

As for the massaging. I just may get a massaging seat pad so I can put it in my car too.

If you want the full effect, get a cordless mouse and keyboard!!
 
Trust me, you will not regret pampering yourself in cushy comfort! GET THIS CHAIR!"

When you first open it and see the cover page with its space for a reward for its return, you know that any Moleskine notebook is a throwback to a more literate time when words and ideas were more important to the people who made them. Holding one allows you to imagine great people doing great things and that owning one brings you closer to them--not just writers, but musicians, scientists and mathematicians or anyone else who needed to have an idea and hold on to it.

In its design, the Moleskine Reporter is a classic with convenience features that make it surprisingly modern. Its built-in rubberized cloth band keeps it from falling open when dropped; it's back pocket allows you to keep miscellaneous papers and items like receipts, stamps and photographs without making you resort to your wallet. Its featureless blank pages allow you to establish your own formatting as you work (making it perfectly suitable for combinations of notes and sketches in landscape and portrait formats)--the perfect feature when your forms of creativity require notes and drawings for visualization. Better still, its semi-hard covers give you a writing surface anywhere you have an idea, from your hand when standing on a streetcorner to your thigh during a train or plane-ride. The Moleskine Plain Reporter is something special, a throwback to a more literate age that is perfectly sized to fit in the back pocket of a pair of Levis"

Rogers,"Seattle, Washington","Just a few months ago, I hadn't ever heard of Moleskine, let alone know about the global fan culture that exists for these little notebooks. When I first saw them in a display in a business bookstore in London, I was taken by their design and functionality as much as by the evocative marketing. Now, about nine weeks later, I've bought my third Moleskine, this small squared ""reporter"" notebook.

I know some people take their Moleskines deep into the jungle, on exotic global treks, or journey with them to the very heights of imagination or contemplation. In that spirit, I take this notebook to the harshest environment I regularly encounter: the gymnasium. My previous gym notepad eventually ended up looking pretty thrashed. I'm confident the Moleskine will fare better, both because it's smaller and because of the fairly sturdy cover.

If I do have one complaint, though, it's about that cover. It doesn't flip fully over to the back, the way the cover on a spiral-bound notebook can, so when you're reading or writing in it, the top sort of flops around. (Maybe the top *does* flip over, and I just haven't brought myself to brualize the notebook that much yet. But it's not obvious it's designed to do so.) Still, it's a solid, attractive, functional, and easily portable notebook. And in a utilitarian environment like a gym, that's a very good set of characteristics to have"

It seems to me that this pen is in effect reteaching those of us how to write. When one tries to grip the pen hard, it is very uncomfortable. Therefore, the pen conditions the user to use less pressure and write with a relaxed hand. With the muscles of the hand relaxed, it is harder to exhaust muscles to produce clamps and aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel. Note that no scientific proof of this hypothesis exists; it is just my observation. The design is good, but the fit and finish could be better.

Sit down on a rainy day with the kids and make placecards for the birthday party, for grandma and grandpa's anniversary or just copy out poetry. This is a great teaching tool and some kids find it a wonderful hobby. A fun thing to do: take two pencils and rubber-band them together. Have your child pick out a favorite line of poetry. Take the pencils on a piece of Bristol board and draw curlicues and lines representing the poem and then fill in the lines with the poetry using the calligraphy pen. Erase the pencil marks with a gum eraser. You have a very distinctive work of art"

We've gone through the paper and the pens have lost their luster to him on their own.  I'm buying another Grande set, it makes the most sense money-wise. Worth the money if your children love drawing."

Allen Greenbaum,California,"I see that ""Linda"" has already laid down the exact same review for all the colors and all the nibs of this pen, so there's not much new I can tell you other than, (1)  To confirm what she wrote, and (2), to add a few new details.

This is an excellent introduction to fountain pens for those with hesitancy about buying one.  I've collected a few vintage and new fountain pens over the years; some of them lay in a display box, loved but unused. On contrast, you will use this pen!  It's incredibly cheap for the quality, so you get a basically positive experience (smooth flowing liquid expression) without the price, or the ultimate cost...losing the darn thing.  At prices ranging from $40 to $400 and beyond (Amazon.com sells a Namiki fountain pen for well over $4,000), the habitual loser of inanimate objects would be understandably reluctant to invest in a gold-nibbed, laquered objet-d'art, and would opt instead for this beautiful cheaply that even CALLS itself ""disposable!"" 


It's a personal preference, but I'd opt for the fine nib over the medium if you're going to use this everyday--you'll write faster and use less ink. The medium is nice for big John Hancock-ish signatures and weighty thoughts, but you lose a little expression (those personal shadings and slight angles that even the untrained can't help but produce). The steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly, and as mentioned above, the ink doesn;t evaporate too quickly.  You can't refill the pen (it's DISPOSABLE just because of that), but you can buy several in different colors and nib sizes, and get some idea of what kind of pen suits you.  

If and when you feel like you want to purchase a re-fillable fountain pen, try for something under $50.  Levenger.com's excellent ""True Writer"" and the ""Retro"" brand pens sell for about this much.  Although those liquidy smooth gel pens have taken some over some of the non-ballpoint market, the mechanically-minded will enjoy the physics of bottle-filling a pen; others will simpy dig the tradition of using a pen with a rich history.  When it comes to fountain pens, the ""P"" is for panache."

The Pilot Varsity pen lays down a great fine-to-medium line of ink, and the nib (IE: the writing tip) does not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir. Fantastic buy; and with no muss-'n-fuss of having to refill the pen either!"

I've tried them myself and I agree. The lead is wonderfully soft, and therefore makes blending colors and pushing them into one another an ease to do. 

The downside is that the lead is a little too soft, and makes it harder to get the colors smooth (it's easier to do with Crayola because Crayola has harder lead). It can be done, however, and these are great pencils that especially go well with Prismacolor markers. :"

It cracked, so I got ""commercial"" iron-on paper.  That cracked  too.  My supplier told me the iron had to be hot enough, and I had to press hard, putting my weight behind it (that's alot of weight... haha). So I bought a new iron, set it at the hottest setting, and I pressed each part of the transfer for the same length of time and I pressed hard.  But I started burning the transfers because the new iron was TOO hot.  So I set it a hair under the highest cotton setting (instead of all the way up to linen), and it was just right.  (For a whole sheet transfer, I first iron around the transfer to set it down; then I press in increments of about three inches for five long seconds, all the way across, making about four or five rows of presses to get from the top to the bottom, and then start all over again going up and down, making four or five rows of presses to get from one side to the other.  I press and lift, rather than pushing. When I'm done pressing, I move the iron in a kind of circular pattern all around the transfer again, pressing firmly.  Then I lift up one edge and peel it back a ways to check the tranfser.  If it looks good, I warm it up again where I'm going to peel, and then start peeling, and let the iron follow me so the transfer doesn't cool down as I'm peeling so I don't get shiny edges. Phew what a pain in the ***.) Anyways, just when I really got the hang of it, my supplier let me down and I couldn't get my professional paper in time for the weekend.  SO I WENT BACK TO THE HP, USING THE SAME TECHNIQUE.  It burned the first time, and so I set the iron about a half a number under what I had it set at before, and didn't iron it quite as long.  It looked really good, but I wanted to see if the transfer was strong enough, so instead of waiting, I threw it right in the washer (inside out, cold water, no bleach; knits-delicates setting on the dryer).  I was surprised how soft it was!  I couldn't even tell it was a transfer, and the color was good!  SO IT WASN'T THE HP THAT WAS THE PROBLEM INITIALLY, IT WAS ME.  If you're gonna use this stuff (or any iron-on transfer), the best thing I can tell you is to experiment on an old shirt.  Try the hottest setting first, and turn it down if it burns.  (You'll know you've burned when you see something like a tea stain on your shirt, it feels a bit fuzzy, and you'll see part of your graphic is left behind on the transfer paper when you peel it off - I think that's because instead of the ink going into the shirt, it burns back into the paper.)  Be sure to count the seconds and make sure every inch of the transfer gets an even, HARD press.  I FOUND THE CRACKING IS MAINLY DUE TO THE IRON  NOT BEING HOT ENOUGH, AND NOT PRESSING DOWN HARD ENOUGH.  THE POLYMERS GOTTA BE SQOOSHED INTO THE FABRIC.  Also, I iron onto a nice smooth piece of wood, and I don't use a pillow case or anything between the shirt and the wood, and I stretch the shirt very slightly and tuck it in so it doesn't move when I iron.  Then I let the shirt cool down slowly, before I take it off the wood (thinking if it cools down too fast, that might make it crack more). Before I got the new iron, I was ironing with a piece of sheet metal on top of the wood to conduct heat.  That was better, but the new iron, getting the temperature right, and ironing hard and evenly, did the trick for me."

I have used many over the years. This is like the traditional guillotine cutter but with a laser light to guide you as to where you should be cutting the paper or photo. This gives a very clean cut. No burred edges, no paper getting caught, straight line exactly where you want it. I do not recommend the small personal paper cutters with fixed blades that push/pull. I also don't recommend rotary blade cutters. Both of these type of cutters get blunt quickly and are quite frustrating. They are also difficult to line up exactly where you want to cut. They purport to cut through a few layers of paper, but this is simply not the case. I find it difficult even using one page in these cutters. After not very much use - such as one or two batches of whole page photos, they quickly give you burred edges and the blades need replacing often. They tell you the grips are large and easy to use, which is definitely not the case. I find the grip of this particular trimmer to be much more comfortable and user-friendly. I also really love the laser guidance. I highly recommend this product to any person that uses it for home office or personal use."

I write notes in class, recopy them, write down proofs over and over, as well as write out a lot of homework. Being a student means that I'm also on a budget! Thus, having a nice, inexpensive pen is key to my success.

I love fountain pens over ball point pens because you don't have to press so hard to write. Pressing hard for so long turns writing into a painful task. This particular pen is actually designed for comfort and I have no problem writing with it for hours on end. It has a slightly triangular grip which makes it easy to hold, and it is also very light. The strong clip on its cap is such that the pen never rolls off any desk.

The nibs or tips of these pens are very strong and can take a lot of abuse. They have the same fine craftmanship as the more expensive lamy pens, but, the body being made of a plastic makes these pens very affordable. I am no expert on plastics but the one this pen is made from is a very high quality and strong. I don't imagine the body of this pen would break even if you drove over it in a car.

Adding to the inexpensiveness of these pens is that, with a converter cartridge, they are also refillable. You have to buy this cartridge separately, but it is only a few dollars, and available wherever the pens are sold. With an extra fine nib, one bottle of ink easily lasts me a year and I drain a normal pen in a day or two. The clear plastic converter cartridge is one which you twist in order to refill it. I like the cartridge much better than the more traditional squeeze and fill ink bladders which are messier and you can't see how much ink is actually in them.

This pen in particular has an interesting look. It is see through, which is fun to look at but also helpful because I can see how much ink I have left and know if I need to refill it before class.

A decent single use pen can cost you 5 dollars easily. The initial price of this pen is more but it will last you forever as well as spoil you with a writing quality far above that of a decent 5 dollar single use pen. Fountain pens in general have a timeless style and this one is especially good looking. It is designed for comfort and most of all, its really cheap"

Now that it's possible to back-up almost an entire hard drive to a very few CD-sized media, it's important to maintain possession and version control.  The possession is obvious: I wouldn't toss out an intact hard drive, for fear of identity theft, etc.  The same is true of your backup media.  Version control may be less obvious, but by dating my latest backups, and then shredding any older versions, I only have the ""latest.""  There are good reasons to keep your older media - I'm just not going to debate them here.

I did, however, have a disappointment with the unit. It simply balked at taking a diskette. It's advertised that it destroys these. And it does if you can get it through the throat.

Fortunately not many people use these anymore but I have some old ones I wanted to get rid of and was not happy with the results I got from this unit in my one attempt to get a floppy through. I plan to call tech support and see if I had misunderstood something or done something wrong.

The floppy finally did get through but only after jamming and balking. Once through, it was destroyed totally.

Bagaria,,"This is perfect for the desktop.  It excels at destroying credit cards, DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc.  In an emergency you can use it to shred paper, including staples.

Because DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc are dense, they lay flat, and take up very little room in the debris basket.  Since paper is light, it will bunch up, filling the debris basket fast.  If you do a lot of paper, you want to consider a paper shredder with a larger basket.

Because it is shredding polycarbonate and metal, the feeder slot snuggly fits DVDs, CDs, and Floppy Discs.  This reduces the chance of high energy debris.  Do Not look into the slot while shredding.  Because of the snug slot, feeding paper into the MD100 is not quick.  If you want to shred less than 8 pages, but cannot leave your desk, you can use the MD100.  If you want to shred more than 8 pages, or can leave you desk, it is better to use a paper shredder with a larger feed slot and a larger basket.

Parisi ""Heather & Robert Parisi""","Pekin, IN USA","WHAT IT IS: 

This ""Charmin Ultra Bathroom Tissue"" is very soft, absorbent, long lasting, and a terrific value. The shortcomings of the Scott's standard mainstay, roughness, are not a concern here. ""Charmin Ultra"" is nearly perfect in every way. 

The NEW ""Gold Standard"" for the bathroom, arguably has become ""Charmin Ultra"" especially if your needs require a softer tissue than the Scott's. Scott's standard bathroom tissue is stronger than Charmin Ultra, but ""Charmin Ultra's"" strength is ample for the intended use of the product. The 2-ply construction makes the 200 sheet rolls go much farther than one might expect and does add body and mass to the product. Add to this the extra absorbency of ""Charmin Ultra"" over Scott's, and I would say that ""Charmin Ultra"" has a clear edge. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: 

Basically, these two products compare much like ""Bounty"" versus ""Viva"" paper towels. While both products score high marks in every area there are significant differences. Bounty is stonger and Viva is softer, making both choices excellent but dependent on the needs of the individual consumer. 

RESULTS OF OUR IN-HOUSE TRIAL BETWEEN THIS CHARMIN & ""SCOTT EXTRA SOFT"": 

We compared ""Charmin Ultra"" to ""Scott Super-Soft"" in what turned out to be a NO-Contest event. The ""Charmin Ultra"" is much softer than the ""Scott Extra-Soft"", though the ""Scott Extra-Soft"" is an improvement over their standard product, but still quite rough.

I had my clay and I had things I wanted to try with it.  So, as part of gathering every possible tool I might ever need, I purchased a clay machine.  It has become the tool I use the most.  

To condition clay,  I use the machine.  To knead clay, I use the machine.  To flatten clay, I use the machine.  I can choose different thicknesses for my sheets, from about 1/4 inch to unbelievably thin.  

The clay machine helps with blends and cranks sheets out so fast, making canes is much faster than without it.  I was able to make several really ugly ones right away--ha!  (Joke for all you old handers out there.)

Finally, the clay machine needs little cleaning.  Just wipe it off with a clean cloth or run old clay through it.  And there are experts on the web who will teach you to break it down, scrub it up, etc. if you are so inclined and just have to see how it works.  I'd rather make beads..."

They have hard lead that gives very smooth laydown. With these pencils, it is always best to start out light and layer your colors until you get a sleek, natural result. 

The problem with Crayola is that the lead is too hard for blending,  i.e, 'pushing' the colors into one another. If you are the type of artist who is into such things, I suggest Prismacolor pencils. But you can mix a little with a white Crayola pencil, so give it a try if you like.

To make your creations permanent, just bake them in your oven at low temperatures.

Easy as this is, Sculpey's baking instructions (use glass, 15 minutes per 1/4 inch, etc.,) are a little too specific for my taste.  As a beginner, I find it troublesome that some of the things I am baking may be thicker than others and therefore undercooked, or the thinner ones may burn if I try to compensate, so do I bake them separately?@!*&! or what?  

I notice old handers just seem to lower the temperature and cook everything 30 minutes.  I'm not that brave yet.  

But so far, nothing has burned and nothing has turned back to raw clay so I must be doing something right.  Or Sculpey is more cooperative than its makers know....

Even better is that I have never had this kind of pen leak or run, emphasizing what a high-quality tool it is. And a personal thing I find attractive is that the ink is pitch black, no faint hues whatsoever. That's just me, of course.

For artists out there, this is a good idea for drawing (reasons above and) because it has a wonderfully rounded tip, so you never need to worry about the point bending or breaking. And you still get a fine line!

Eisenberg ""student physician""","San Diego, CA USA","The next time you find yourself in a classroom, check out the teacher's pen. Whether used to grade kindergarten handwriting or comment on English 101 compositions, the Pilot Precise V5 (especially in the color blue) seems to be the first choice of teachers everywhere.

Rollerball pens are clearly more expensive than the commonplace ballpoint models, but justify their cost. Despite their similar name, ballpoints lack the fluid line, precise control and quality ink found in rollerballs. I make do with cheap ballpoints to take notes for medical school and on patient records in the hospital (my handwriting deserves no better), but my wife, the English Major (actually Linguist), will accept no substitutes. Joyanna loves the bright, classy blue of these pens and the way she can control the thickness of the line with the lightest touch. 

Pilot apparently makes use of a proprietary ink control system; it makes up that funny stack of baffles in the first part of the shaft behind the tip. With the fine, pointed tip, it makes for lines of even thickness and color with only a light touch (it can be hard to get used to for pen-mashers like me). The clear plastic ink-gage on the side is useful. Joyanna has tried slightly cheaper pens, but a 12-pack like this seems the only option that is truly satisfactory. Pilot's V7 is similar, but makes a thick 0.5 mm line instead of the thin 0.3 mm line produced by this model.

The cap on the Precise V5 seals tightly and has a strong metal clip. As with all standard rollerball pens, changes in pressure on airplanes can be dangerous. Pilot tells you to hold the pen upright when removing the cap in a low-pressure plane cabin, but Joyanna still keeps her pens in a plastic bag when flying.

After writing with these for 7 years, there's just nothing else that compares. For me, the Pilot is the most conducive pen in getting the thoughts in my head onto paper. It's smooth and fluid, writes with the epitome of ease and precision, and has a nice minimalist look. I'v graduated to buying these in boxes rather than just single pens because I hate being without them and having to use &quot;other&quot; pens. Once you try the V5, you'll know what I mean"

I teach English so I grade many, many papers and I refuse to write with a boring pen.  I used to use my antique shaeffers until a student almost dropped one.  I had to have a daily pen that was, well, near disposable.  I remembered the Lamy and ordered a Safari.   Now, if something happens to it, I don't have a stroke.  Plus, the broad nib has a wonderful ink flow!

I give them as gifts.  They are a good pen to start using as they are very forgiving.

Do they write as well as my older pens?  Nope.  Are they more user-friendly?  Yup.  (Think mid 60's Jaguar E-Type versus 2005 Honda Civic.  Which is more fun to drive?  Which would you drive to the grocery store?  Get my point?)

Bottom line:  It is a $25 pen that you'll use more than your $100+ antique pens."

Yasuhara ""carless in...""","Seattle, WA","The Joy is an elegant addition to Lamy's well-designed line of affordable, functional fountain pens.  I'm a big fan of Lamy's Safari for everyday writing and have been using one for years (see separate review).  The Joy is the longer, pointy-ended, calligraphic cousin of the Safari, which is also a plastic fountain pen with windows on the side.  In fact, the caps are interchangeable, and the threading joining the front and back halves of the pen is the same, so I normally write with a Joy nib section screwed into a Safari back end, since I don't like the Joy's long end section for everyday writing and carrying in my bag or pocket.  Aesthetically speaking, I like the long, tapered design of the end, which reminds me of the dip pens I used to use for art and calligraphy.  While this design is fine for a pen that lives on a desk, it's a little too long for carrying around the campus or office.  That being said, I consider this a matter of taste than a problem with the design.

Like the Safari, the pen nib is durable and writes pretty smoothly and consistently...easily the best of the various pens I've tried in this lowest price range.  It's a light pen with a relatively narrow, molded grip section, so stay away if you would rather write with a hefty, chunky pen.

The 1.1 mm straight chisel nib is perfect for me.  I'm a lefty, so most oblique nibs won't work.  The chisel nib is just wide enough to give my otherwise ordinary handwriting a pleasant, calligraphic and more substantial quality.  (With the right inkn and paper combination, you get beautiful variation in tone and darkness in your strokes as the ink dries.)  However, it's not so wide that I can't write with it every day, unless I need to write really small.  I write letters, take notes on standard lined paper, address envelopes, fill out forms, sign checks, etc. with this pen without worry.

As an everyday user of fountain pens, I can say I really enjoy writing with this pen and the Safari, both.  However, I only dabble in calligraphy and cannot speak for this pen's appropriateness for someone who does that sort of work more seriously.  I expect this would be a good starter pen, however, for a beginning calligrapher...possibly one of the wider nib versions, if they don't expect to use it for everyday writing or fine (as in small) calligraphy work.

p.s.  If you like a more serious, industrial look, Lamy makes a version of this pen in black plastic and aluminum"

Yasuhara ""carless in...""","Seattle, WA","I have a Lamy Safari and a Lamy Joy (both in the colored, plastic versions---not clear or aluminum).  I got this converter so I could eliminate the waste of disposable, plastic cartridges and use the bottled ink of my choice in my pens.  This converter has good capacity (refill frequency varies, of course, with ink, nib, paper, and writing habits) and a long knob with two flats that's easy to twist for refilling.  The body is clear and makes it easy to see how much ink is left through the windows in the pen body of the Safari and Joy.  With practice, I can now fill the converter with one hand, holding the converter body between my pinky and ring fingers and twist the plunger knob with my thumb and pointer finger.  This leaves my other hand free to tip the ink bottle, if necessary.  I've been using one of these converters for years, and they seem to last fine.  It's a simple device, but I can think of worse designs.

I remember one time I was supposed to tail a dissident on his way to meet his CIA contact.  I followed the guy over the Charles Bridge towards Old Town, but then lost him in a crowd near the town square.  I went back to the bureau shame-faced, but my understanding superior told me to write up a detailed report about what I saw and where.  As I sat down to write that report, I realized that without an accurate map or detailed notes, I could not reconstruct what I had witnessed, so I made something up.

I ended up making up many of my reports, mostly due to my poor organizational skills.  If I had had my maps and notes in one, compact and convenient notebook, I might have saved myself a lot of trouble.  My understanding superior became much less understanding when he found out that I was writing fiction, and soon I found myself in Noril'sk, Siberia, north of the Arctic Circle, where I have seen people's eyeballs freeze in their heads.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, I packed my things and left the KGB, but the idea of revisiting Prague has never left my thoughts.  This time, however, I plan to have my Moleskine City Notebook: Prague with me, and you can be sure whatever notes I write will have nothing to do with dissidents or defectors, and everything to do with the best restaurants, oldest architecture, and warmest hotels that Prague has to offer"

These envelopes are a little bit pricey, but they do accomplish what one needs a #10 security envelope to do;

1]- They are made of relatively heavy paper and reinforced where something like a check might be within the envelope.

2]- They self-seal, which for me is a very big deal, as I usually either get them too wet or I cut myself, if I have to seal them myself.

3]- They come in a nice box, which I usually give to one of my kids when its empty. It keeps them thinking about re-cycling.

4]- I can pick them up at Office Depot and avoid shipping this item.
