Collins,"Oakland, CA","This seems like a great idea - the food is held in a basket, so that you don't have to shove a skewer through the meat. However, the little bolts that hold down the clamp onto the rack are meant to be tightened by hand. If you have a sizable chicken, you cannot tighten these enough by hand. I had the chicken fall out of the rack into the flames more than once. Then you have to tighten them with pliers, but the metal is so soft that you can only do this 2 or 3 times, and then the threads are stripped and the whole thing is useless! Again: hand tighten = chicken falls out; tighten with pliers = threads are stripped. Now I have to try to get replacement parts for the rotisserie from Weber. Good luck"

Post,,"This seemed like a pretty slick idea, and was a pretty clock.  All it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs aren't lying, that it really is near lunch.  
I set it near our front (glass) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on.  So I hung it in our office (no window).  Two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night.  Apparently that can interfere with the signal.  Rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal, this thing was off by an odd amount of time, like an hour and 27 min by the next morning.  

I set it manually, and today it's off again by about an hour.  

The instructions to reset which I got from Tech Support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery, and what it's expiration should be.  

Man, that's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true.  For $25, and the packaging being gone, this is in the dumpster.  I'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month....but takes a month to show the error"

Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.

Unfortunately, it has some annoying flaws.
1) Although it will provide either 12 or 24 hr format and either Celsius or Fahrenheit temps, you can't actually select the temperature display--once you select 24-hr time format, you get Celsius temps whether you want them or not.  If you want deg F, you must select 12-hr time.
2) If you run the clock off batteries, you have to press a button to get any projection.  Unfortunately the button you press is the snooze button, which activates both the projection and the backlight; the button to control brightness of projection does not work in battery mode; activating both lights simulaneously is both redundant and wasteful, as it runs down the batteries more rapidly than necessary.
3) Worst of all, the device emits a very annoying, very audible, high-pitched whining sound any time any button is pressed (including the snooze) and anytime you need to set or reset anything.
4) Manual confusing; information on website did not tell me anything I needed to know.  Emailed support--no acknowledgement, & although I eventually got a response it wasn't remotely helpful, and I had already given up on them and returned the device"

However, the rails along the sides that hold the shelves are not welded together well.  In fact, two rails arrived completely broken off (opposite sides and at different levels) and a third was tenuously held in place by a single weld.  I thought that the broken-off rails were parts to be used in the oven's assembly; otherwise, I would not have unboxed the smoker and put it together.  I would have returned it. 

Because I had assembled the unit before realizing that it was broken, I thought that replacing the broken parts would be easier than disassembling the unit, re-crating and returning it.  I called the distributor three weeks ago to order replacement parts that have not yet arrived.  I've already waited longer than the distributor indicated I would have to before receiving the parts.


If alternative gas-fueled smokers didn't cost a multiple of what this costs, I'd be really angry.

Hands down, this is the most unsatisfactory purchase I've made from Amazon.

In spite of the impairment of not having a fully functioning smoker, I have seasoned it and used it once.  The chicken I made was promising. (My hope that my experience with this smoker will improve lets me award a rating of 2 stars based on this one use.) If I ever get the parts I need, I think the smoker will be adequate for initial experimentation with this kind of cooking.  If I like the results, I'll replace this smoker with a better one"

Also, I don't like to use the spray too often or have all the baits, gels, and other poisons around, so I decided to try these things. Unfortunately, they don't work. The first week I bought them I saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room. The ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it. Instead of this repeller I use Limonel (orange peel oil) is a safe alternative to use when children are present, and it does repell and kill the bugs.
So, how to get rid of roaches? Seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam, wood sealer, etc. Mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents, so I put mosquito screens to block their way in, also I sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and I bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor.

There is no place to grab the adapter with a wrench or pliers to get a good grip on it to turn it.

Save that little plastic inner piece that comes with it as you can get an adjustable wrench around the square outside of that to turn the adapter out for a while, until the day comes when the torque required is too much for the plastic inner piece.  I would also recommend greasing up both sets of threads, the ones on the new tank and the ones on the Hansen Gas-Mate II adapter.  AND DON'T OVERTIGHTEN IT putting it into your new full tank.

This adapter is another bad design by Weber.  This adapter should come with either a strong metal inner piece that helps you remove it, or it should have some portion of the adapter itself on its outside that operates like a nut and serves as a grabbing point for a wrench"

But when reapplying the nut and washers through the bar and heat shield, it WILL strip unless you get lucky and tighten it just right the first time. This bolt needs to be made of good steel... and it's not!  If it's tight just let it be because you will strip it if you mess with it. It is impossible to find if you need to replace it because both hardware stores I went to didn't have it and didn't know where else to find it. It is a 6mm 2 3/4"" bolt. My solution to fix the stripped bolt was to add 3 washers before screwing on the nut and thus catching on some fresh unstripped thread. Luckily there was enough bolt showing. Had that not worked this thing would have been junk just 1 day before Thanksgiving and I'd have been rushing off to buy a differant one.
Just look over your parts before assembling this thing and make sure those bolts are as long as they're supposed to be and if not make that one trip to the store for bolts and washers too. I guess whatever model/brand you get will be made in China too (isn't everthing?) so I don't want to recommend another, besides I've only owned this one. Make sure you follow ALL precautions about using this thing to the letter. I would also add that even a little wind will slow down or stop your cooking time as the burner blasts out the gas so fast (which is normal for that hot a flame needed) that the fire is only on the tips of the gas so find a relatively wind free place, errect/effect/find a windblocker/lean-to but DEFINATELY outside and away from structures or anything that can fall and knock over your pot. Gobble Gobble!
By the way the turkey was soooo good that everyone raved about it and wanted to take (did take) it all home. Look around for tips on preparing, injecting and rubbing the bird. I kept the temp at 350 (initially at 375 but after you SLOWLY... slowly dip in the bird the temp will go down) and then maintain 350 from there out. Get a bird at 15lbs or under (or the pot will fill too high)  and cook for 3 1/2 min. per pound. Look for more tips online. That bird was tastey"

Although EZ-UP sells products on their web site to facilitate holding these canopies down in the wind, they do NOT cover ANY ""wind or rain damage,"" and although this, in my view, was NOT a factor of why the frame failed, the company's first response when I called to get a return authorization after it failed only after about 8 months of use, they quickly stated ""we don't cover wind or rain damage, cut me off, and had apparently NO reguard for anyone's safety, stating that if it was raining or even in the slightest wind (I think it failed in around 2 mph ""winds""), their ""warantee"" did not cover it! They said I could send it in and THEY would determine (after paying an outrageous sum of money to send it back) IF they might replace it, but that they likely would not. The people at the company were rude, had NO concern that their product had some safety issues, and so I'm looking to buy something less expensive, and that lasts longer! INteresting, they told me that they don't cover ANY wond or rain ""damage"", yet they also sell hold-downs & it states on their web site (& apparently in directions that I never received with mine) NOT to fold it up if it was wet, but to leave it up!

I had a MUCH less expensive shade that latested MUCH longer and I'd recommend others to do the same, or to buy an industrial model that CLEARLY stated in their warantee that the product can withstand wind up to ""x"" mph & that it is made to withstand rain as well. 

After my experience with this company's product, and their staff in the returns dept., I would avoid ever buying one of these again! I received mine as a gift (that cost my friend over $200!)

There are MUCH better, sturdier, and safer canopies out there. 

If I could give this product a zero or negative score, I would!

These canopies are NOT NEARLY as sturdy as I recall them being years ago (or perhaps that was another brand?) 

I expect these canopies will be recalled in time due to safety issues.

This is not acceptable for a unit of this cost. Check and see if you unit is made from ceramic materials or from Portland cement as in the case of mine. unless kamado has changed their manufacturing process in Ensenada, Mexico the units are made of Portland cement.

Adjusting the contrast does not help. Wall mounting might be a better option. The buttons, as stated in another review, feel mushy when pushed.

The anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole.  The anemometer works consistently and fine.  Both OS and the local distributor say the distance is too far, the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement, etc.,etc.  Replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other.

You have to take out eight tiny little screws to insert the backup batteries or plug in a sensor cable into the nifty looking ""solar powered"" sender unit, which has to be placed somewhere in full sunlight for it to function at all. Once you've mounted the unit on your roof, you have to remove those pesky little screws on the roof, in the freezing wind usually, several times a winter. Or wait for Spring and nice weather when you don't need to know if you can expect black ice on your early morning drive to work. 
Sometimes resetting the base station works (which you have to place inconveniently so that the unit has direct line of sight communication. Usually not. OS Sales has it advertised at 300 feet, but actually something less than forty if your batteries are more than a day old (see battery change procedure above). By the way, there is a backup nicad battery in the unit, supposedly kept charged by the impressive solar power collector. This will fail because it rapidly loses capacity due to a poor discharge recharge cycle. If any of these three fail, the unit won't function. 
Strangely enough, my rain gauge (I live in the desert) has continued to function for over a year with little attention. However, the temp/humidity sensor which I would like to refer to most often, is what fails every night. I'd like to replace the Nicad battery, but can't find one anywhere. 
Ahem. Customer Service and the lack of it. I don't know how many emails I've sent. Or calls I've placed. Or time I've spent listening to the backside of the Oregon Scientific hold button. Their website only lists complete systems in the replacement parts category.

This service took 2 months to complete with Oregon Sci. The anemometer then quit 12/2006 and Oregon Sci. said tough luck it's out of warranty. The Thermo-Hygro quit 2/2007 and once again, tough luck.

 My thoughts on the unit besides it not functioning after 2 years: Cheap and cheaper. The manual is nearly worthless. The anemometer is accurate to about 60 Kts. then gets wildly optimistic. The temp.,humidity, baro seem accurate. The rain gauge is kinda funky the way it reports because of a delay built in and the resolution but it is useable. All of the failures I have had I think are related to water intrusion into the sending units. Everone has had green corrosion on the PC boards when taken down from the rooftop. The sealing of the units is very poor and the use of phone cords is very cheap. 

 I just got off the phone, again, with Oregon Sci. and Juan from customer Service told me ""we can't help you"".

I have little flies of some sort in my Hydroponic vegie greenhouse. I bought this seemingly easy little hunk of plastic to make a sound that's only bothersome little animalsand bugs hear. 

4 days after purchase the little guys seem to be flying to the ultrasound. The jig and bop back and forth like they are dancing....I bet they are dancing, making love and reproducing to the Ultrasonic waves! 

I killed more bugs inhaling while plugging this in my Green house. 

Rather then take it back I suggest you huck it at a Black & Decker Exec as the are robbing us telling us this thing works. On the box they site a study but don't show it's reference. When I called BD they said, ""We don't know what study that info came from"". They are hornswaggling us! This is gonna be big like Enron! Corporate Karma! 

Update- 7 days later. I really wanted to give this product a chance as I'm lazy beyond belief and plugging stuff in is right up my alley. If I have to go buy Lady bugs or pest spray I'm gonna be pissed. 
SOOOOOooooooo I bought 4 more and plugged them all in for 3 more days in my small greenhouse...... not a damn thing happened. Actually I think it works like a rave and extascy for the flies. There are more of them now and they seem to be having much more fun!

So in conclusion, This thing sucks more then the suckiest thing that ever sucked a suck. Only buy it if you need some extra plastic hanging from your outlets."

It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.

My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh.

B00009MKCT:rm_323a_is_*very*_poor_compared_with_rm826a:h._ragsdale,B00009MKCT,Oregon Scientific RM323A Atomic Travel Clock with World Time: Outdoor Living,outdoor living,2 of 2,1.0,RM 323A is *very* poor compared with RM826A,"March 18, 2007",H. Ragsdale,"Pelham, NY USA","Sorry to say it, as I've liked Oregon Scientific products in the past, but this is a junker.  Two chief problems.  First is that it doesn't know how to switch over to daylight savings time correctly.  I understand that the switch-over dates were changed this year, but this is the more recent model clock, and the older RM826A has no trouble this year.  I got up an hour late on that first daylight savings time Sunday in March.  Sadly, even if you manually set the RM323A to the correct time, it will reset overnight to the wrong time.  The only way to fix this (per Oregon Scientific's web site) is to turn off the radio connection to the atomic clock, thereby defeating the reason for owning this clock in the first place.  (In fairness, O-S says that it will work fine after April 1, but what about future years when the dates change around?  My guess is same problem.)  The second problem is that it's very difficult to use, including such basic stuff as setting an alarm.  Granted, Oregon Scientific clocks don't have a lot of buttons, so it has to be a little complicated to handle all of the functions.  But this particular clock has both a ""single alarm"" and a ""weekly alarm"" that goes off every day at the same time, and selecting which one, setting the alarm time, and even just turning on and off the alarm is anything but obvious.

I suppose the world time capability could be useful for some folks, but I find this clock worse in every respect than the RM826A, which is no longer manufactured.  I'm going to toss this one in the trash and find a couple of RM826A's before they're no longer available.  Oregon Scientific has no more in stock as of a couple of days ago"

The gazebo uses cheap plastic hooks to hold the screens and canvas sides. When it arrived, some of the hooks were already broken. Within a couple of weeks of wind, more had broken. Replacement hooks are not available from the manufacturer.

Unlike the other reviewer, we did not find a problem with the stability of the structure. OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM is with the top. After the first summer, the nice chocolate brown top faded to a very light tan. The side also faded, but in a very uneven manner. We also noticed that where the clips attached to the fabric of the top there was fraying. By the end of the second summer, most of the clips had broken loose from the top, rendering is useless.

The data it downloads from its external monitor to the PC is terrible.   Even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database.  It also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall.  The amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount.  The hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically. You might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later, the last 24 hours shows only .2 inches of rain.  Strange.  How can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24?  Seems backwards.

On the good side, the unit is easy to set up and connects to your PC with existing ports and a cable that is provided.  On the bad side, besides being inaccurate, the analysis software is primitive and difficult to work with.  You are better off downloading a text file and doing analysis in Excel.   

This unit also gives eratic readings with the temperature swinging up and down up to six degrees within a twenty minute window.  I wanted my son to see how the temps over a 24 hour period form a bell shaped curve.  So much for that.  This is probably OK for a first time weather station for my 8 year old but I would not recommend it for any one else since this unit is not cheap.  

One other thing, it only takes a reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings are hit and miss.  You could be getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens to read.  I am dissapointed and annoyed that I spent the money and it is not at least semi-accurate.  I will tell you that I have it set up wireless.  If you use the enclosed hard wire connection option then you will get more frequent readings and maybe even better accuracy.  Good luck and do your homework first."

I had to return the unit 3 times, as well as do a store replacement once, and I used the system for a year without the wind speed unit working - I simply didn't want the cost of returning the system yet again.  The software is absolutely horrible, and during the 2 years I had the system, there was never any software upgrades at all.  Given how deficient the software was, this was quite surprising.  For example, there is no calculation of daily rain amounts or monthly rain amounts.  The system is too stupid to differentiate between days.  The date recorded to the simple spreadsheet database is always one day off (yesterday's date is recorded today).  Overall, the software looks to be a high schooler's science project done the night before it was due. If you're going to purchase a La Crosse system, plan on spending money on 3rd party software, as well as allowing about 30% of your purchase price in product return costs. La Crosse tech support is non-existant: call & get a recorded message to leave your number & they will return the call - but they NEVER do... and I do mean NEVER!  Send an email and the same response - NONE!  It's a very frustrating joke.  After 2 years, I gave up and purchased a truly professional system from a competitor.

1. The Wind Gauge reads low. During Hurricane Katrina the maximum recorded reading was 28MPH versus gusts of 75MPH. The trees can be bent over from the wind and it reads 5MPH.

2. The unit will just stop transmitting from the outside unit to the base unit. We have changed the batteries in the outside unit 4 times in the past year but continue to have this problem. Better than 50% of the time now nothing works from the outside unit. The range is now down to less than 50ft from the base station. I don't want to move the station any closer to the house because the wind and rain sensors will be impacted.
 
3. The rain gauge does not update very often and it reads significantly lower than the local weather station. It rained heavy last night and the local news reported 1 inch of rain but we recorded 0.2 inches. 

4. The barometric pressure appears to work well. 

There are better buys out there like the Oregon Scientific WMR968 that have a real 330 ft range so save your money"

I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess.

However, if you live in the east coast, you must recognize that you are farther away from the radio source. This clock may not be able to set itself unless, for example, placed near a window. This is NOT a fault of the clock, but rather a limitation of the radio waves.

R Schryer,"Hampton, VA United States","One thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate U.S. atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. Such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second, they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. Furthermore, such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. Yet while most Americans have, for example, the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones, relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. This model is just one of many styles sold by Amazon and other vendors. Try one and I think you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted, no what time system is in effect"

Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin.

I like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella -- very low tech and smart. My one ""issue"" with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for -- they are totally stationary, and don't have a tilting feature. That might be standard, I just don't know, but I would have wanted that flexibility. Oh, and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible. And they're simple to put together and take apart. Great price and they block the sun and look terrific"

(redesign?),"September 27, 2005",Christopher Davies,USA (UK ex-pat,"Bought this umbrella last week (9/23/05) from Amazon. Was initially hesitant about purchasing it due to other reviews describing the issue with the pole being in two pieces, which, when connected, were never straight. 

All I want to add here is that I did not experience this problem. The screw mechanism which joins the poles seems sturdy, and the pole appears perfectly straight. I wonder if other people had bought umbrellas from a bad batch or that the manufacturer redesigned the connection mechanism? (The most recent reviews do not mention this problem)

Re. overall quality, I can't speak for how the pole or the umbrella itself will wear over time, but at least initially it looks to be of good quality and sturdy construction. One thing to note is that despite the product description and picture making it look like the pole is made of wood, it appears to be actually made of some sort of metal which is wood coloured (it still looks like wood though and would not look out of place with wooden patio furniture). To be honest I actually prefer this, since I would imagine it won't discolour as easily as natural wood and should be longer lasting.

In summary, am very pleased with my purchase - I would happily recommend it to others looking for a good quality umbrella at a very reasonable price"

What a grill!  I don't know how Weber does it (convection, perhaps?)--even my overdone meats come out moist and flavorful.  Veggies come out great--I grilled zucchini squash last summer, and YUMM!

This grill gives me the best of both worlds: gas and charcoal.  The gas feature allows me to light up quickly, rain or shine.  The small propane tank is not the primary energy source, so seldom needs refilling. Charcoal gives foods real barbeque flavor, and my gardens love Weber's convenient one step ash disposal system.

I cannot praise this grill enough.  I only wish the newer version inspired more positive reviews, and hope friends I recommended the Performer to can still find this model"

Since it's a horizontal-style smoker, it can also double as a BBQ pit/charcoal grill.  Plenty of room, very versatile.  Treat it well and it will give you a decade of use.

The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the thickness of the metal.  If it were a little thicker, there would be much more heat retention.  You can buy smokers with 1/4""+ thickness, but expect to pay at least $600.

This is easily the best smoker in its price range.

Make sure you season the inside of the smoker similar to how you would season a cast iron pan.  As with any smoker, before use, paint the interior of the smoker with shortening or vegetable oil, then start up the smoker and let it smoke for a couple or few hours.

Also, you should almost always keep the chimney vent all the way open.  Use the intake vent on the firebox for temperature control."

the one caveat i would offer is one many reviewers have noted, the color is not as pictured.  the amazon photo shows an almost teal green with a white middle section.  the photos on the product box call the color 'mountain green' and show a forest green type color, with a cream colored middle.  mine, however, is a dark olive color, one that could as easily be called brown ad green, and the middle section is a cool, cement-y grey, not a warm white at all.  
it looks nice, and is a great cover at a great price.  but if youre ordering this to match your patio furniture (i certainly wasn't!) then this is something to be aware of.  
the only other warning i would offer is to make sure it fits your grill.  its a big cover, and not very adjustable.  fits my char-broil grill perfectly, but it would look ridiculous on a smaller grill.  
the only features i would wish for here are a loop or hook on the outside of the cover, so i could hang it up when grilling, instead of just draping it somewhere, and a drawstring of some sort at the bottom, to hold it closed.  still, it is so heavy and well made, im certainly not complaining."

One recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer (about $7) for accurate monitoring of the smoking. You'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels. It also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat.

After 7 years, the heating element broke and new ones are $40 through Char Broil. I'm appalled that they're so much, and am contemplating buying another smoker instead."

I got this cord at Lowes and it cost around $18 dollars. The manual  says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker..but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can.

Couple of tips that took me some time to work out.

1) Cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it. This'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly. You won't have to refill it during the smoking, and it'll prevent the smoker from getting too ""wet"" inside. When I left it uncovered, I was getting steamed meat, not smoked.

2) Drill a hole in the bottom of the unit, and get a drip pan underneath it. This'll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust.

3) Get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element. Makes cleanup much easier, and gets the heat reflected up to the food.

Have fun..."

Just drop in some wood chips, fill the pan up and you are ready to go.   Very easy to use, not much maintenance.   I regulary pull out the electric element, put in some charcoal and use it for roasting whole chickens, roasts, etc.   I've even just used the bottom piece with charcoal as a grill and it's works great.
You will be surprized how well the food comes out, I have smoked a few hams and friends will tell me its amazing how that little smoker will cook.  You do not need to spend a lot of time getting it fired up, as a wood smoker, and if you want, you could smoke with only wood.

Cons :
Would like to see a temp guage on it.

Overall, you cannot lose out with this smoker, I live in a warmer climate so I have not experienced the problem of the smoker not getting hot enuoph, at times if I want to speed things up, I'll add some charcoal to it.  Can't beat it for the money, and it does not have a very large footprint at all"

B000659JQK:fantastic_for_all_types_of_cooking:s._jordan,B000659JQK,Weber 7790001 Summit Platinum D6 Propane Grill: Outdoor Living,outdoor living,,5.0,Fantastic for all types of cooking,"April 17, 2007",S. Jordan,,"This unit is well-built, will last, and is easy to use.  Assembly is a breeze.  We have had it almost two years and it performs superbly in all types of cooking-- it heats up quickly (and gets HOT!), yet the flames can be turned way down and never blow out.  We use it several times a week and a propane canister lasts about three to four weeks.  Of course, if you turn all its mighty burners on and leave 'em that way, it'll eat a lot of propane.  But that kind of usage would quickly cremate anything you might be cooking.  I suspect that people who complain about propane consumption with this barbecue are cooking with the hood up, contrary to Weber's instructions (and common sense).  And, let's face it, any barbecue with six mighty burners like these will use its share of propane.

Pluses: 

Thick, solid stainless steel bars sear beautifully and will last forever.  You want solid bars!  The thermal inertia is key to good grilling.  And stainless means no rusty taste, no chipping, and easy to clean.

Fine flame control.  Six burners let you configure the heat the way you want.  The rotisserie and smoker box have thier own burners!  The side burner works well too for cooking veggies and stuff in a pot.  

Powerful yet capable of gentle cooking.

Won't rust.

Built like a tank.

No cheap Chinese componentry as often found in even formerly premium brands, and all ""house brands"", most of which are made entirely in China, even the big stainless-steel extravaganzas that sell for thousands.  Don't be fooled by fancy knobs and gewgaws-- the quality is just not there deep inside far too many barbecues today.  I've personally witnessed two big top-of-the-line house brand barbecues returned to a leading warehouse retailer by irate purchasers who couldn't believe they'd crap out after a year.  That never happens with Weber.

Convenient fold-down work surfaces.

Easy to clean.

Huge cooking area.

Anti-flare burner configuration works well.

Lights instantly.

Easy to wheel around the yard-- something I wanted to be able to do, and which a built-in wouldn't allow.

Fantastic Weber service.  Mine was manhandled by the shipping company; Weber handled my complaint with the shipping company for me (I didn't have to do anything at all) and sent me a new panel without any hassle at all.  Their 24-hour support hotline is the best I've used anywhere for any product, and emails are handled same-day.


Negatives:

Expensive (but worth it).  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  It was my first Weber after years of thinking they were only popular because they're stylish.  Now I get it."

Beazley ""GrillZilla""","Friendswood, TX","It's hard to do better than a Weber and this grill has not disappointed in the two years I have owned it.  I use it 3-4 times a week and have cooked just about everything you can imagine on it.  I am very satisfied with its performance, but it has a few minor flaws.  I still have my Genesis series propane grill that is still fine after 12 years, but it was not big enough so I moved up.

Pros:
Stainless doesn't rust.
Large enough to cook a substantial amount using indirect method.  Last night, I simultaneously grilled 4 T-Bones, 10 skewers of tequila-lime shrimp, sweet peppers, and bread.  That's why I wanted this grill.  I need room to cook.
Insulated box holds the heat well.
First side burner I've had that actually works.
Assembly was relatively easy.
Strong rotisserie motor.  Spin a turkey or 3 chickens; no problem.
The smoker box w/ its own burner is a great feature.
Stainless grates are better than any others I have used in past.
Lots of shelf space w/ fold-down shelves.
Battery-fired push button starters for all burners is easy and reliable in all weather conditions.

Cons:
Expensive.  But I do expect a long service life.
Gas guzzler.  More than one tank is helpful.
Couldn't find a cover that fits it.  But it is stainless...
Gas gauge doesn't work that well, but no biggie.
The bottom of the cookbox has warped a little resulting in the grates being loose and shifting more than I'd like.  On occasion when cleaning the grates, they will fall into the bottom of the cookbox.  I can work around this and probably fix it without too much trouble, but it does tick me off.  This cost them my 5th star; I expected better.

So I pretty much love this grill and it's a good thing, because I believe I'll have it for a good long while.

Chad, the weird chain on the door is for manually lighting the grill.  It is a match holder on a chain attached to the door so you won't lose it.  Go figure"

I've had it for a year, and it's been awesome. It Gets hot quickly, it sears food well, and it has all the bells and whistles. 

The stainless steel grates are the primary reason to get the platinum and not the gold. They are worth it, unless you want to use plain cast iron and constantly oil them (which also you'd have to buy). 

A couple of things to consider though:

1. The design is kind a retarded for the smoker box. Using the smoker box and the rotisserie is chore, you can't really open the smoker box because of the spit, and the smoker box seems to want to rely on the grates (which I remove to use the rotisserie) so with the grates gone it will tip over easily. 

2. The grill has blown out a few times. I think this is due to the fact that I don't follow the instructions and turn the gas off when I'm done using it, I just turn the grill off. So the regulator has a protection mechanism that gets tripped, and off the grill goes. So I've changed the way I use it, and it hasn't blown out since. 

3. There are these weird chains in the doors of the cabinet. I have no idea what they are for, and no one has been able to tell me. 


So, if I had it to do over again, I'd get the exact same grill, it's worth every single penny."

McKenna ""BMac""",Virginia,"This grill has it all, six burners, a side burner, a rotisserie with infrared burner and a smoker box with a dedicated burner.  The grill grates are 3/8"" stainless steel rods that provide great grill marks on your food.  The grill heats up to 600 degrees in less than 10 minutes, but it does burn through propane rather quickly, but that wouldn't be any different with any 60,000 BTU grill.  I was able to put the grill together by myself in a little over an hour.  The fit of the pieces was fantastic and the end result was an attractive incredibly stable grill.  It has two pull-up counters with stainless steel inserts, and a cabinet with stainless doors.

So far I have made countless steaks, dogs and chicken breasts that all came out the same due to the even temperature on the grill.  My old Charbroil would give me two raw breasts, two good breasts, and two overcooked breasts... not with this grill.  I have also slowed cooked some ribs with the smoker box going and the meat fell off the bone.  But, the best meal yet was a rotisserie chicken that I prepared with a rub and injected with a marinade.  The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.   We'll be making many more of those chickens in the future.

Weber is a known commodity.  They are built to last, and given the quality of the components (with care) I expect this grill to last at least 15 years.  Many people end up having to get rid of their Weber's after 10, 12, 15 years because the cart has rusted out, but that's not an issue with this grill as the cart is constructed of 304 stainless steel.

All in all, a great grill that will last a long time.  My only cons would be the propane consumption and maybe the size.  It's probably a little too big for me and my family, but it was the only Weber that had all the features I wanted (mainly the rotisserie and the smoker box with burner).  If they had a four burner model with those options I would have gotten that, but alas the Weber Summit Platinum D4 does not exist"

And the most important feature to me is: they allowed me to upgrade it to stainless steel cooking grates and flavorizer bar for only $20 extra. (which is $100 value on amazon.)With the regular grates and flovorizer bar, you have to replace it in a couple of years and hard to clean. But the stainless steel type may last much longer and easy to maintain.

Excellent product. There's plenty of product info on this page from Amazon and the manufacturer, so let me tell you a few things that I do to make my Weber work best for me.

-Most importantly...keep it covered. Amazon sells a cover...get it. Not coving it will cut its life in half at least.
-Cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and THAT does not make a steak taste very good.
-Change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink).
-Get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...NOT after. The build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements.
-Before each use, after you wire brush the grates, put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down.
-Pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot.
-Initiate cooking steaks, chops, any cuts of meat (even burgers...no, not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. This brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat. 
-Cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing).
-Let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). This locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite), they'll run right out of your cut of meat.

There you go. Hope that helps. And don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. Bon appetit!"

(redesign?),"September 27, 2005",Christopher Davies,USA (UK ex-pat,"Bought this umbrella last week (9/23/05) from Amazon. Was initially hesitant about purchasing it due to other reviews describing the issue with the pole being in two pieces, which, when connected, were never straight. 

All I want to add here is that I did not experience this problem. The screw mechanism which joins the poles seems sturdy, and the pole appears perfectly straight. I wonder if other people had bought umbrellas from a bad batch or that the manufacturer redesigned the connection mechanism? (The most recent reviews do not mention this problem)

Re. overall quality, I can't speak for how the pole or the umbrella itself will wear over time, but at least initially it looks to be of good quality and sturdy construction. One thing to note is that despite the product description and picture making it look like the pole is made of wood, it appears to be actually made of some sort of metal which is wood coloured (it still looks like wood though and would not look out of place with wooden patio furniture). To be honest I actually prefer this, since I would imagine it won't discolour as easily as natural wood and should be longer lasting.

In summary, am very pleased with my purchase - I would happily recommend it to others looking for a good quality umbrella at a very reasonable price"

My previous grill was a Coleman, and had lasted a good 10 years, although the cooking quality had definately deteriorated.

I was going to purchase another ""cheapy"" grill, but in my research, I noticed something - almost every Weber owner rated their grill 5-star, whereas the cheapies usually mustered three stars at best.

A little more research quickly pointed out why - Webers may not last any longer than the cheaper competitors, but a 10-year old Weber still cooks better than the cheap ones do when brand new.

I invested in the ""Platinum C"". but have yet to use the side-burner, so I'm not sure how valuable that is. I was delighted with the quality of the Grill - it was easy to assemble, and the cooking quality is - fantastic.

Stoltz ""turbojimmy""",NJ,"At first the thought of spending $750 on a grill seemed insane.  Then I started adding up all of the $250-$350 grills I've had to buy in the 7-years I've owned my home. Based on reading hundreds of reviews, I figured that a stainless steel grill made by Weber would be the last grill I'd have to buy.  I think I might be right.

I bought the natural gas version, which I would highly recommend.  No more messing around with propane.  Just turn on the valve and you've got flame.

I've had the grill outdoors for 4 months now (somtimes covered, sometimes not) and there are no signs of any corrosion anywhere.  The stainless steel cleans easily and polishes up nicely.

The drip catch system is higher quality than I've seen, with a ceramic coated 'funnel' that drains juices down to the tin catch pan. Nothing collects near the flames so flare-ups are minimized. The 'flavorizer' bars immediately incinerate any grease that falls on them.  The grill is easy to dismantle for cleaning.

The front-to-back burners provide perfectly even heat and a lot of it.  The thermometer on the grill easily spins past the highest marking of 600 degrees.  At these temperatures steaks sear nicely and the grill is almost 'self cleaning' since any stuck-on food is almost completely incinerated.  Anything that remains on the grill easily scrapes off the stainless steel grates.

The front-to-back burners also allow you to use the grill like an oven.  By shutting off the center burner, you can use indirect heat to cook food without searing it. The insulated hood keeps heat inside which makes the grill more efficient but also makes it easier to stand next to while cooking (not much heat radiates around the grille).

I'm convinced that this grill is an excellent investment"

The rotisserie fits my Weber Performer grill (which I also like a lot) perfectly, which is no surprise since it's made specifically for Weber's 22 1/2 inch kettle grill.  The spit has a nice chrome finish, as do the forks, and appears that it will last.  

This is my first rotisserie unit, and perhaps this might be common knowledge, but after using it a few times, I found that using the balancing weight works best by first putting your bird or roast on the spit, then inserting the loaded spit in the ring without the weight tightened down or inserted in the motor, so that the spit may find its own balance, which naturally will have its heavy-side down.  Next, I tighten the weight opposite of this heavy side, insert it in the motor, & turn it on.  I then play with the positioning of the weight relative to the spit, but remaining opposite of the heavy side, so that it spins with the least amount of strain to the motor.  (Hope that wasn't too wordy.)  Anyway, I've cooked chickens, a roast, and a 12 pound turkey (hoping to cook a big honkin' turkey soon), all with great success.  

In conjunction with the rotisserie, I've finally discovered the Canjun Injector, the hypodermic needle-like flavor injector.  Using both brings out juicy and flavorful foods.

One other tip...carfully open and keep the box that the rotisserie came in for storage.  I put some self-stick velcro on the box ends, and it keeps this otherwise awkward to store gizmo safe and stack-able.

I plan to buy another rotisserie unit for my Weber gas grill.  I don't know why, but in addition to the more succulent outcome of the food, seeing your food spin around the fire adds to the anticipation of the meal"

S. PETRU ""photo_nut""",Chicago,"You may wonder why it took me 20 years to write this review... well after using this rotisserie for all that time, the motor finally stopped working.  So, I got a new motor this week.  And I'm ready to go.

I have cooked just about anything you can put on a stick.  As everyone says, the results are just phenomenal.  I've done 16-21 LB turkeys, standing rib roasts, Leg 'o lamb, pork roasts, chickens, duck, goose, you name it, I've cooked it. Just put the food on, add a few hot brickets every so often, and let her go.

One tip, there are two ways to cook with this.  If you want even heating, don't take the lid off too often. Releasing the heat with the lid off you lose the ""convection"" effect, but that's not all bad. For some meats, like leg of lamb, where you want the outside crisp, keeping the lid off works well if you stoke your fire to keep it hot.

Finally, Weber's customer service is phenomenal"

Grimes,"Tampa, Florida USA","1st, I've read a thousand reviews and this is my first, yeah, and maybe last.

I've had it 3 months and after month #1 it deserved 3 stars. After month 2 earned 4 stars.... now top rated.

It does chicken best.  The lid (a CON) doesn't fit tight on the rotisserie ring so the fire burns hotter than I would like.  So.... this is what I do:

1- skewer 2 chickens thru the chest-back at an angle.  Then season with a dry garlic herb (or lemon pepper). If you season first then most is removed when skewered. Seperate the chickens with an onion or potato. Don't tie.

2- center the charcoal 6"" wide across the center of the kettle from side to side.  When the fire is 1/2 started put the chickens ABOVE the flame.  The fire will burn fully because the lid doesn't seal (remember?).  The flavor is where the flame meets the chicken. No other way will work..

3- Cook for about 45 minutes or til the skin pulls away from the end of the chicken legs.  Looks burnt? The skin might be but the inside is great. Trust me.  Take it off the grill and let it rest about 20 minutes.

Flame still going??  Skewer some red or white potatoes.

 Tastes great and sooo moist!  Pack leftovers in a sealed plastic bag and it will keep a week.  OK, I am guessing on that part.  Mine only lasts a few days..

Another CON is the cost.  It should have included a skewer length basket for holding ribs, fish etc.

So this is the end of my review.  I have bought some junk on the 'net..... but this one of my better choices.

However, after a little bending into shape, it fit more snug.  The way the ring rests on the kettle, there will alway be some gap, which does not allow for a good seal.

After I finished the assembly there were some rain and the inside was try except a couple of water drops. The only concern is its sturdiness since it's assembled with 28 pieces and so far so good. I don't expect it can stand a ternado or hurricane. One thing I wan to alert you: when you buy the shelves do measure the inside and ignore the manu since if you buy the side according it yuo will find the shelves will shift too much to the left or right.

The mounting brackets did not fit, there was no counterweight, and the meat forks were cheaply made.  

THIS unit however, is great.  First, the mounting brackets are truly ""universal"", and should fit just about any grill.  Mine mounted perfectly on my Aussie Bonza Deluxe 3 grill without issue.  Installation only takes about 5 minutes.   The mounting brackets allow for various distances between your grill's mounting holes, and multiple sets of holes allow for various height adjustments.   If your grill has two holes on either side, you should be set.

The single-piece spit rod is heavy duty, the counter weight included is heavy enough to assist with balancing heavier roasts (or chickens), and the four-pronged meat forks are well made. 

The motor comes with a long cord (about 3 feet- most other units have much shorter cords!), and the fact that the motor has an on/off switch is a nice plus.    

Lastly, for all the praise I can give this unit, I was also pleased that it's attractively priced.  I have seen many other rotisseries that seem to be much more expensive, and not built nearly as well"

I am not a pro, so take my opinion as such.  I bought this last week and put it together in about a 1/2 hour.  The only problem I had was that a flimsy weld on the control panel broke, which meant it did not hook onto the bottom of the smoker neatly.  It was nothing a little electrical tape could not fix, and was probably my fault for forcing it.  I plan on fixing it with a bolt and nut later this week.  The rest of the unit looks well built.

As far as smoking, it did great.  I put some garlic and water in the water pan, a mix of apple and mesquite in the wood chip bin, and put the smoker on low.  As long as I had the vent wide open it stayed at 175 F.  If I closed the vent the temp got up to 200 F.

The whole chicken I cooked was great.  After four hours of smoking on my back patio, the chicken was moist and had a delicious hint of BBQ.  It was smoking pretty good for a couple of hours.  My wife had doubts about me buying a smoker.  Now she has a BBQ menu planned for next week.

Everyone who had some of my smoked pork thought I was a proffesional at smoking with my Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker. I am doing some beef brisket this weekend to see how it turns out. Alot of people have been saying that thier Smoker was in bad shape because of the packing from the manufacturer but the Smoker I bought from Lowe's was packed in a cardboard box with foam supporting everything and nothing was damaged or scratched on my Smoker. I would recommend this Smoker for anyone that wants a Very Good and easy to use Smoker. OH Yeah' It's also easy to clean!"

Reece,,"The Great Outdoors Deluxe Smoker is exactly what I was looking for.  The LP gas is great for easy temperature control.  All I need to do while smoking is periodically check the level of  liquid in the pan (and add more wood chunks if desired).  The temomitor is easy to read and appears to be made of good quality.  The only complaint I have is the smoker is not foam protected inside the cardboard box when shipped.  Thus, my smoker had two minor dents in the corner of the smoker.  They do not affect the operation at all."

Kinda wishing I saved my money and just got the smokey mt though... here is why:
    I got my grill at home depot so I would have the nice Cast Iron porcelin enamel coated grates.  When using the smoker you must remove one grate and replace it with a supplemental smaller grate so that the smoker will fit on the side.  This grate does not sear like the cast iron!!!  Weber also does not make a cast iron to fit this size, so when using the smoker, you only get 1/2 of a grill to make nice sears on.
   However, I havn't taken it out since I bought it over a week ago, so I guess the flavor is worth it. ;-)  In regards to the previous review, I have had no trouble smoking a pork sholder for 5 hours, and the smoke was thick and rolling the whole time.  I think the key is to soak the chips for a minimum of 30 minutes (i'll let them soak for hours if i think ahead).  Make sure you load up enough chips - I pretty much filled the tray up.  SHUT THE LID OF THE SMOKER!!!  That part is key!  Especially when heating up the grill.  When heating on high I've found it takes slightly under 10 minutes to start to smolder, turn down the grill now!  Before it starts a full on smoke!!  I wasn't going for ""low and slow""... but wanted to maintain a 325 degree oven for the entire time.  I checked the internal temp at 3, 4, and 5 hours getting the pork up to an internal temp of 182 (figured it would rise another couple degrees after I took it off).  The pulled pork was AMAZING!  Plus I got the pink ring!!!  It was my first smoking experience and I fed 10 people with the recipe from Weber nation (i doubled it).  So long story short... if you already have the gas grill and don't want to invest another $300+ in a smoker... try it out!  It may not be as great as the smokey mt. but it really SMOKES"

It was totally a sitcom setup in that I lived in my mom's basement - but the mice and spiders down there were not funny at all. I didn't really mind the mice running around every now and then, but when one got under the covers with me, I had enough. I went to a local brick & mortar store and bought all kinds of different traps, deterrents, etc to try to get them out or trap them without harming the critters (Mom wouldn't have it). I bought a single two-pack of these things and immediately after I plugged the first one in, I saw two mice immediately come out of their hiding spot and scurry to the unfinished part of the basement. Having one in my bedroom and one in the bathroom in the basement was enough for me, but Mom's husband was so impressed that he bought about a dozen more for the rest of the basement (lots of separate rooms) and the garage.

Definitely read the tips and suggestions - they will only work if there is a large, open space so put this in an outlet that has a ""full view"" of the room. Each room will need it's own, and a very large room (like a two-bay garage) will need two or three.

The projection feature is great and the projection display is actually larger and brighter than I thought it would be. 

To be honest I have to mention the drawback - the display on the clock itself is so small and not backlit so you have to be pretty close to it to see the time during the day. 
Until someone puts a projection feature on a larger size CD/alarm clock, we will continue to keep our old alarm clock and put this one on the other side of the bed and use it mainly for the projection feature.

According to the owner's manual, the presence of the antenna icon indicates that the clock is in the radio-controlled mode.  When this icon and the associated signal-strength bars are flashing, the clock is in the process of synchronizing to the NIST reference.  If either two or four signal-strength bars are displayed, there is sufficient signal for the clock to synchronize.  If no bars are displayed, it is not safe to assume that the clock is synchronized.

The display also contains a time-zone map of the US with the selected time zone darkened, and either ""AM"" or ""PM"" next to the antenna icon, thus eliminating two more reasons to question the displayed time.

Although the year is not explicitly displayed, it can be derived from the display when the user chooses to display the day of the week instead of seconds."

A lot of LCD displays that I have seen on clocks, etc have been very dim and to me, very unsuitable.

Another feature that this unit has is automatic time updates and I found that it not only works, but works in my work place office. My office is an interior office (ie not located near any windows) and it is able to pickup the time signal through our building walls. This is amazing!!

I have also found the JM889NA-S to be very attractive looking and very well designed.

Martin,"Kissimmee, FL","This little clock worked exceedingly well at first.  Clear, large display that was bright enough to read but not so bright it was distracting at night.  It takes up little space on a night table, which is great.

However, if it's on your night table you'll have to angle it so that the clock face is nearly toward the wall, as you can't adjust the projection.  If you face the clock out toward the far wall, the projection will be diplayed upside down.

Still, I was okay with this, as the projection was what I was interested in.  And that worked great until it accidentally got knocked off the nightstand onto the carpet.  One mishap and the projection was broken.  Nothing could fix it; you can't even open the clock to explore the mechanics of it.  Without the projection, it's simply a procey bed-side alarm clock.  It's my fault for knocking it over, but I would think a clokc of this caliber should be a bit sturdier"

Sussick ""sassy vixen""","howell, NJ","I recently purchased this clock and it's a great little clock! The time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful. The projection (usually on the ceiling) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening.

The only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down. I mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down. 

The atomic feature was a bit tricky also. I live in central NJ and when setting up the clock for the first time it didn't pick up any signal. After I searched for a signal, took the batteries out and tried everything I knew and everything the manual mentioned it wouldn't get a signal. So I had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions, the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal (by pressing the down arrow) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal, which is shown by the meter on the left, like a cell phone. Once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself (you may need to take it outside)...this can take from 10 mins to days. In my case it took about 5 mins. So it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal. Other than that problem, which is fixed, the clock is hassle free and very easy to use.i highly recommend it. Oregon Scientific was also helpful and I sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual, because if they did I wouldn't have needed to bother email the customer service. Hopefully most people didn't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they didn't they may have returned the clock needlessly.

The alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor.

Overall it's a cute, useful, and stylish clock."

I checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child (didn't want radio, CD, telephone, and other features).

** Pros **
1. Very compact size, fits good next to bed
2. AC adapter with battery backup (even came with batteries)
3. LCD display doesn't have annoying illumination while trying to sleep.  Blue ""glow"" activates only when very easy to find button is pressed
4. Straight forward buttons and controls that took about 2-3 minutes for my 7-year old to learn.  Buttons are a good size and are not real hard to press.
5. Great styling as a kids clock
6. The projection feature is a BIG hit.  Projects about 4"" high numbers on ceiling.
7. Projection intensity is good for laying in bed at night without lighting up the whole room
8. Decent construction for the $$$

** Cons **
1. None for my particular application
NOTE: If you are looking for a projection clock to use during the day (visible projection in sunlight), you will be extremely disappointed"

The Driveway Patrol fixed all that. Setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door, it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door. I originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so I aimed the sensor low ACROSS the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine. It now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived. 

The Driveway Patrol actually saved me quite a bit of trouble one day when I had been waiting the entire afternoon for the cable guy -- he eventually showed up late, didn't even bother to knock or ring the bell and only stayed just long enough to leave a note telling me I wasn't home. Due to the Drveway Patrol, I managed to wave him down at the end of the drive. This alone made the gadget worth the price.

As I've said, the Driveway Patrol does exactly what I need it to do. The only false alarms I get are from visiting neighbor cats, racoons and the odd bird. The only things I would change about the gadget would be to add a volume control that had more settings than 'loud' and 'very loud' and the fact that the chimes will ring continuously while being triggered and then for another 10-15 seconds beyond that"

The sensors have been out in the hot Florida sun, cold nights (well, for Florida, down to about 26), torrential rain, and still work great.

As soon as the temperature decreases though, they become much more reliable. I WOULD NOT RECOMENDED THESE DEVICES FOR SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITH HOT WEATHER, SUCH AS ARIZONA, TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, ETC. Original review: I am very impressed with this alarm: It is accurately able to detect people coming up the stairs of my apartment, and sets off the indoor alarm -- and it has not sent out any false alarms (Most problems with this alarm (that I have read in the reviews below) appear to be caused by the sensor being in direct sun light. This seems to cause these units numerous difficulties, and should have been addressed in the Patrol Sensor's enclosed instructions -- but isn't. However, by simply shielding the outdoor sensor from all *direct* contact with the light of the sun by using tape or opaque plastic, or repositioning the outdoor sensor, appears to eliminate false alarms or no alarms). This alarm unit appears to be quite well made, and the price is, of course, incredibly low. Great buy!!"

You get the chair and the foot stool which is why I rated it 4 stars.  The quality is decent, I think for the price you get what you pay for and a bit more.  The kit comes almost constructed--you have do the final screws.

The chair comes pre oiled, however I highly recommend oiling it again, if you want the color to last.  I also recommend Teaqua, do not use conventional Teak oil.  I do agree with the previous reviewer that if you sit in the chair for an hour it can get uncomfortable, however I purchased cushions for it, and sitting for an hour has not been a problem.

The construciton is sturdy, they have been sitting on my deck for about a month now and all is well.

I did my home work on the internet and found that La Crosse made good quality unit at a reasonable price. After opening the box when my WS-8025 arrived and reading over the instructions, I had it up and running in under 20 minutes. The WS-8025 allows you to adjust the barometer to local conditions (which you can get on line from your local schools).
    I've had it up a running for two weeks and find that the WS8025 does a good job of forecasting the weather. The atomic clock took a day to link up (which they tell you in the manual it might) but has stayed linked up since.
    I purchased the optional TX3UP with remote probe that I have in my fish pond. So besides seeing the outside temerature and humidity, I can keep an eye on the pond. You can set the WS-8025 to alarm at any high and low temperatures that you chose. (Which came in handy the other night when the pond heater failed).
     So far I'm happy with my purchase and I like the way the LaCrosse WS-8025OAK looks on the wall."

I own a 5-year-old Charbroil that is bowing out and losing heat/smoke when I cook so I wanted a multi-fuctional grill to replace it that would last longer.  The Summit S-450 includes a beautiful smoker box with a dedicated burner and a Rotisserie Kit.  More importantly, it is a Weber, which means great warranty and customer service and built to last.

When I opened the item with my friends we all salivated at the heavy-duty construction of this grill.  The impressive stainless steel was high-grade and the grill was very heavy.  No wobbling.  It was very easy to set up and took about one hour.  Let me say that although I expected this grill to be better than my old, I never thought it would be so impressive in all aspects.  Weber thinks about everything when they make a grill.  From the heavy gauge stainless steel grates to the high-end burners this grill really catches your eye.  Having researched the grills at all the local hardware and big box stores, I can honestly say this grill beat them all with just looks and materials alone.  That was even before I attached the propane and lit the thing!

When I did test the burners I was extremely impressed with the ignition system.  I've never seen anything like it and all burners, including rotisserie and side lit on the first try.  The grill got up to heat very quickly and the eveness of the heat was evident buy looks and using a hand test over the grates.  While I only cooked a hamburger for my first meal, I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful grill marks the grates left.

I do a lot of slow-cooking and smoking and the thermometer, smoker box, and seal of the grill will certainly improve my grilling of carolina pulled pork and briskett.  Further, the knobs/temperature controls seem to offer infinite heating options.  I cannot wait to experiment and learn with this grill as I add items to my menu.

While I just got this grill yesterday, I am more than hopeful of the quality and craftmanship and truly believe it will last triple the amount of my Charbroil.  I'll have to add to this review as I continue to use this wonderful grill"

You must locate it in a spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight does not affect it as this will most likely give false readings.  If you have a glass door or window that leads to a screen enclosure, this would also allow for a fairly correct temperature reading, although this could also cause improper readings in the heat of the day as the metal pan roof can reflect heat to the inside of the screen enclosure.

Simply fill the aluminum cup in the tray with beer, wine, fruit juice, or some other beverage. For extra flavor, add spice as well.  Place the infusion cone on top of the cup, then place the chicken on top of the infusion cone.  Once the chicken is in place, put the infusion cap on top to lock in the steam.  Steam cooks the chicken on the inside, heat on the outside.  Chicken is tender and juicy on the inside while the skin is cooked to a golden, crispy brown.  Fat and grease drain away from the chicken and collect in the bottom of the roaster instead of the grill.

To remove cooked chicken from roaster:  Remove the infusion cap.  Next, take a pair of tongs and go down the back side of the chicken and slide it off the infusion cone.  This is easy to do since the roaster is nonstick.  If your chicken is heavy, you may need to support it with a second set of tongs"

Brown,"The Desert Southwest, USA","If you've ever made Beer Can Chicken then you know what a problem it is sometimes to get the chicken to sit properly on the grill with only a beer can for support. 

The Weber Poultry Roaster solves this problem, and goes several steps further to result in a moist, tender and absolutely delicious chicken. This item gets 5 stars and two thumbs up!!

The pan has a well in the center to hold the beer. This by the way uses less liquid than traditional Beer Can Chicken, which leaves more of the golden nector for other purposes such as drinking for those who prefer to do so. The medieval torture looking prong device sits over the beer well and the chicken in turn sits on this. Weber includes a round cap that fits on the top of the chicken to help seal in the moisturizing juices. The pan then sits in the grill and collects the chicken drippings, thus keeping the grill cleaner. The chicken sits very securely in this pan with no chance of opening the grill to find it had fallen over.

The non-stick coated surfaces make this roaster pretty easy to clean up, especially for something that's been sitting in the grill for an hour or so.

We've used this roaster several times, and are still just as thrilled with it as we were on day 1. The chicken always comes out so moist, tender and flavorful it's hard to believe it was grilled! 

I highly recommend this roaster, in fact I've even given them as gifts."

First about the price:  I got this at Home Depot for $16.95 because I needed to grill in a hurry.  If you do not have an OPD tank for your Weber grill and can see yourself in the future refilling, and you would receive it in time before you run out, then I would recommend getting it on Amazon for the lesser price but can afford shipping time.  

If you have an older Weber grill and wanted the tank to be refilled, then you probably understand the frustration that I had to go through to get more propane.  Federal Law has mandated that all tanks now be ""OPD"" certified.  Now, on these OPD tanks, which can be detected by the ""star"" shape of the handle, has a different opening where the hose on your grill needs to be connected as compared to the older model.  So when I went to have it refilled, they told me that they could no longer refill my old model.  So I bought a Blue Rhino.  Then, I could not connect it to my Weber grill because of the different opening.  (The propane hose would not adapt to the tank.)  So I now had three options.  One was buy a new grill, which would be quite expensive.  Second, which Weber recommended, probably because it would cost me more money, would be buying a new hose.  (They said it was around $40.  And I have also heard that it has a problem with squirrels eating it.) And third was this adapter that I found.  Thus, this adapter was the answer for the price.  Connect the thread side of the adapter and your hose to the other side of the adapter (This is the ""spring side"" or ""quick connect"" side where to release the hose from the adapter, you must just pull back on the end part of the adapter.)

A picture of the adapter with the the new tank and old hose can be found here:
http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/HDUS/EN_US/asset/images/eplus/161203_3.jpg

I also have some advice on using the product to which I hope you may find useful.  (The installation instructions were quite weak with the product.) When installing, there is a black plastic piece which is used to screw in the adapter to the part.  Be careful when using your crescent wrench not to break off the part.  If you break the plastic piece, you probably will be unable to take off the adapter from the tank in the future.  Therefore, I would also recommend placing the piece in a safe place so when you need to refill, it will be handy to take off the adapter.  However, if you lose the piece, or break it, there is one more way to have it refilled.  There is an adapter which was placed on the old tanks for refilling.  And since this product basically converts your new tank into the old one, then you can place this refilling adapter on the product.  I know it can be confusing in words, but basically what I am saying is that you will have adapter on adapter when refilling the tank.  Your refill store will most likely have this second adapter for you when you go in to refill.  (I get mine a Pool-Mart and they usually have this handy.)  But just to be on the safe side, I would keep that plastic piece.  But back to installation:  When you finished screwing it in, just connect your hose to the other side by pulling back on the only part of the adapter that moves, and once you push the hose end into the adapter, push back up the only part of the adapter that moves to lock the hose in place.  And to remove the hose, simply pull back on the sliding adapter piece - the only part that moves.  But most likely you didn't need that as you have refilled your old grill sometime in the last several years.  But just in case you may have needed it.

And on performance, there are no leaks, as shown with the soap and water test.  Just pure gas grilling is all I have now until another law is passed.  But until then, I recommend two things:  First is buying this adapter, and second is using common sense to install it, not the instructions.  Happy grilling, and thanks for reading"

This thing really works as advertised. I have already found several coins and other things right in my own yard. It will reliably indicate what coin is being detected although it many times confuses dimes and pennies on the LCD readout. It is very sensitive and detects most coin size items very reliably to about 6 or 8 inches. The auto notch discrimination works well and filters out most trash items. I have used metal detectors that ended up being aggravating and frustrating. This one is a pleasure to use and is quickly becoming a relaxing and profitable pastime for me. If you want a serious metal detector without spending a whole lot of money give it a try... you won't be disappointed..

Davis ""famousdavis""","Boca Raton, FL USA","Our old General Electric indoor/outdoor thermometer's outdoor sensor broke this summer, so it was time to replace it with a weather station that could give more info about the weather than just the temp.  I live in South Florida, and it's nice to know what the heat index is, because in the summer, our temps along the coast rarely rise above 90 degrees, but the heat index rarely is below 100 (in which case I choose the indoor treadmill over running outside).

I bought this unit on the strength of prior reviews, which I think are pretty darn accurate in their overall assessment.  I can't present much new information here, but I will validate some of the prior comments.

The weather station is constructed of cheap plastic.  I think if this station falls off our kitchen bar, where it rests today, it will break into smithereens.  It'll be best hung from a nail on a wall or put in a location where it's not going to fall to the ground -- ever.

The weather station has a clumsy vertical design with a small base so I think it'd be pretty easy to bump into it and knock it over.  The same advice in the above paragraph applies here, too.

The weather station does emit a high-pitched tone when you press a button to backlight the display for a few seconds.  It's not a big deal to me, but some might find that annoying.

The weather station does have a clutzy, non-intuitive method of setting the display which really does call for pressing the Set button up to 11 times!  Each depression of the Set button selects one area of the display to be set, and there are a lot of settings being displayed (time, day, date, etc.).

It was pretty easy to spend a moment setting the weather station (despite the clutzy interface), and because I live in the Eastern time zone, my job was made easier because the default setting is for the Eastern time zone.  The clock automatically synchronized with some atomic clock somewhere, so that part worked just fine.

As for accuracy, well, I've had it only a few days now, but it seems to be working alright.  We've had rain for the last few days, and the barometric display -- which only shows clouds/rain, partly sunny, and sunny -- accurately forecasted the cold front by the drop in air pressure.  When I put the outdoor sensor next to the indoor sensor (inside my house), the readings were within a few tenths of a degree from each other.  The humidity readings were exactly the same.

The weather station reads between .3 and .7 degrees warmer than my old indoor/outdoor thermometer.  I wouldn't know which of the two digital displays is accurate -- my old thermometer or this new weather station.  The weather station does seem a lot more jumpy when it comes to reading the indoor temp.  It's quick (when compared to my old indoor thermometer) to change the reading when, say, the air conditioning turns on.

Having the lunar phase display is a nice touch.

Overall, I like this unit so far.  I wish it were constructed of more durable plastic -- my old GE indoor/outdoor unit is built to be thrown against a wall without being damaged -- and I think I'd prefer a thermometer reading that wasn't quick so jumpy with temperature fluctuations.  I like the humidity readings for both indoor and outdoor, and I especially like the heat index calculation.

In all, I would recommmend this weather station to other buyers"

The base unit receives its signal from the remote that I placed on the north side of the house on a shaded porch. In between are 4 walls since the two units are located diagonally across my house. Absolutely no problems with reception.

I purchased an additional remote (THR138). When I place the base and two remotes side by side at room temperature and let them stabilize for about 15 minutes, all three agree within 0.3 degrees Farenheit.

Read the manual! Add batteries to the remote(s) first, press the reset button(s) with something non-conductive (a toothpick), and THEN add batteries to the base unit.

I live in a cold climate. While I haven't experienced sub-zero temps since purchasing this unit, my other Oregon Scientific wireless thermometer, an RAR232, has worked just fine with alkaline batteries at -16F this season.

Excellent value"

The more we looked into it, the more confused we were. We didn't know what features we needed or what to look for. We didn't want to spend too much but were afraid to go too low and end up with one that didn't work well.  We decided on this one based on other reviews and price.
It came with a video which helped us understand about the model and how they work in general. Just practicing around the yard he found two colonial coins.  We've only taken it on one camping trip and found a silver dime, some quarters, pennies, and a silver Mexican Peso in New Hampshire about 4 inches deep.  My husband is getting the hang of it.  The more items you find, the more you understand it.  He says that when it says it's junk, turns out it is junk and it's been right on with quarters and smaller coins.  
We are very happy with the unit and feel we made the right choice.  I would have given it one more star but my husband hasn't found any jewelry yet"

Shop around because you can get it for less then one hundred dollars if you know where to look... cough... ebay... cough... ebay.

I've found tons of silver coins with this detector.  It's target processor is extremely reliable for coins.  If you get a solid repeatable coin tone then you've got a 95% chance of digging up a coin.  I've also found Civil War buttons, old toys, and multiple rings at the beach.  Yesterday I found 2 Mercury Head dimes (1918 and 1941) in a local park.  Believe me when I tell you that treasure is in the ground everywhere.

Contrary to another review that you may see below, the All-Metal mode works exactly as it should.  Not only does it work as it should, but it is the most useful and descriptive mode on this machine.  Mr. David Carlson obviously doesn't know how to operate his metal detector.  The symptoms that he describes are the result of someone not reading the manual.  He doesn't understand the relationship between All-Metal mode and Ground Balance.  It just takes a moment to read and understand.

Bottom line:  Great metal detector to get you into the hobby cheaply so that you can begin finding some great stuff.  Like I said, I've been using mine for 2 years and I don't feel the need to upgrade"

I am only cooking for two so it works out perfect because you get the preformance of a Webber but you use verry little charcoal. Don't forget to shut the vents when you are done cooking, this smuthers the coals then you can just add about half as much as you would otherwise need next time. Getting a chimney gets your charcoal ready with only newsprint as your starting aid in about 10 minutes. As far as preformance goes you can't beat a Webber you can grill (no lid extreamly hot), or you can smoke or bake with the lid on. Read the cook book that comes with your grill and you will be an expert in no time. The only negative is they replaced the wooden handle with plastic."

Lang,"Dayton, OH USA","I have long been skeptical of ""deep frying"" at home.  The smell, the mess, the smell...Anyway, I recently decided to throw a fish fry and decided it was time to invest in a fryer.  The biggest issue for me in purchasing a fryer was the sturdiness of the burner stand.  Besides having the ability to heat 12 quarts of oil, I also wanted a burner stand that would hold the weight of 20 quarts of beer for my homebrewing.  I decided on the Bayou Classic.

This Bayou Classic kit came with everything and setup was simple.  The burner stand exceeded my expectations for sturdiness and the height was such that when using the 10 quart stock pot, you could place the burner stand on a safe sturdy work surface to elevate it off the ground.  I plan on also using this burner with my wok.  The burner was able to bring the oil to temperature in approximately 15 minutes.  The Fish and Chips turned out great.

Of course when using 350 degree boiling oil, you do not want your weekend fry festival to end with either a trip to your local burn unit or a reason to see if Allstate really has you in good hands.  Common sense must prevail and last time I checked, Amazon does not sell that yet.  Set your fry area up away from kids, pets and anything that you want to see another day.  If you follow that simple advice, all should turn out okay.  

Clean up can be best described as ""sticky"", but in order to get the life out of your aluminum parts, don't skimp.  Now that I have tackled fish and chips, I will have to move on to the other ""must have"" fried foods these days: turkeys, chickens, and Twinkies.  I can't wait."

Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The basil is the first to sprout. The parsely seems to be slow but steady.  

Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal.

They did change the price back to 399.99 the next day...Anyhow it came in a huge box, thank god the deliver man was nice enough to bring it in my condo.  Instructions say 30 minutes to put together for the average consumer, but I would say at least 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Plus you do need a second person for 1 step.  After assembling we fired it up and instant ultra hot heat!!  This thing gets burning hot fast.  We did some shortribs and salmon.  They both did stick pretty good to the grates which was annoying, but I assume since it's new it will take a few times of cooking before the stickiness goes away.  

Plus the only reason why I was ""forced"" into a gas grill was because my condo association did not allow me to use my Weber charcoal performer(great grill) by the way!!  I am now actually happy they did force me to lose the charcoal because this grill definitely outweighs charcoal for convenience hands down.  I used to occasionally burn food on my performer....but I don't see that ever happening with this 

Although I got a screaming deal, I would recommend this over the E-210 simply because the 3 burners a must have for rotisserie and indirect cooking!!!

I can't wait to buy a rotisserie unit, summer will be sweet!"

For the past few years I've been switching back and forth between my gas grill and my good ole Weber kettle grill.  Like everyone else I prefer grilling over charcoal, so this seemed like the perfect grill for me...  

I was right!

This grill takes all the pain away from grilling with charcoal.  One push of a button and 15 minutes later I am grilling ribeyes.  YES!  It is that simple.  The chimney revolutionized how I grilled with charcoal, but this is 10 times better than that.

The propane ignition rocks, the work area is great, the lid holder is a nice addition, and the water proof charcoal holder is more convenient than I thought it would be.  Let us not forget it has a dual purpose thermometer!

It took me about 40 minutes to assemble, but that's to be expected.

Oh yeah, I ordered it on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday."

I previously had a regular Weber kettle charcoal grill, but when my son took it to college I had the perfect excuse to upgrade.  
The grill is large enough to grill meat and veggies for a family of 4 to 6. The cooking grate has hinged sides. This allows you to easily add more coals every hour or so for extended indirect grilling cooking.  You won't believe how handy the very large and stable table is; it is very durable and cleans up nicely.  
Store your large bag of charcoal in the rain protected bin, then just pull out the bag to pour charcoal right into the 2 charcoal holders. The charcoal holders keep the coals gathered together to light well and eliminate the need for a ""charcoal chimney"".  You only need to run the propane burner for 5 minutes to get the coals started, so one canister lasts quite long. (I always set a timer so I don't forget to turn it off.) The charcoal holders are perfect for indirect grilling, just push them to the sides of the kettle when the coals are ready. If direct grilling, you can still use the charcoal holders to heat the coals, then use tongs to dump the coals onto the bottom grate when they are ready. Very convenient.  The bottom wire shelf makes a perfect spot to set the hot charcoal holders after you dump the coals into the grill.
The stainless steel ash catcher works very well.  (The non-stainless ash catcher on my regular kettle grill didn't work as smoothly and used to catch and jam sometimes.)
The lid holder is really great.  Just pick up the lid and slide it to the left and it is held in place for you.  No more trying to hang the lid from the little lid hook.
The thermometer is very handy to monitor temperature for longer cooking items.  If you are BBQing ribs or a roast, keeping the temperature regulated low is important.
All these little conveniences simply add up to a nice cooking experience.
I enjoy my gas grill too, but it takes a little more skill to cook over charcoal.  I have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when I serve up a perfectly cooked meal from my beautiful Weber Performer grill.
Find a spot to show it off - this beauty really looks great in the yard"

Kennedy,"Brooklyn, NY","I love this thing.  It is, of course, basically a Weber kettle, which is all you need.  The tweaks are terrific, though.  The gas starter works like a charm.  I'd thought that moving from lighter fluid to a chimney made getting the grill going almost as clean and predictable as turning on your kitchen oven, but this is even better.   The work surface is really handy, the kettle top holder is dirt-simple but works just fine, the charcoal trays for indirect cooking are nice, and the charcoal storage is handy (but more about this in a minute).  The built-in thermometer is really an asset.  It's an ordinary meat thermometer that can sit at the top of the kettle or be removed to use on food.  It's very helpful when slow-cooking using the kettle top to know what the temperature is (and fun, beside, to see the grill ""breathe"" as the coals burn down, or you add more, or the vents get adjusted, or whatever).  Then when you're about done you can pull it out and check the meat.  Simple but great.  All the little things add up to make this a cut above.

A few things.  The instructions that come with the grill can be read to mean that it's necessary to use the charcoal trays with the gas starter.  You don't; either a chimney or just a pile of charcoal work perfectly well.  Turning the gas knob just enough to get a flame, and running the starter for short times, will extend the tank's life; three minutes or so seems to be plenty to get the fire started.  And look for a scoop or something similar to use with the charcoal holder, or plan on getting your hands dirty moving charcoal.  Overall, though, this is a great setup.  I did a hickory-smoked leg of lamb last night that was to die for, and about two-and-a-quarter hours from pressing the starter button to on the table.  Fabulous."

Yesterday, as I was cooking some pork chops on it, I made a mental note to come here to review.

Personally, I believe it is the best charcoal grill for most people.  Like others have said, it is so easy to get the charcoal started without using lighter *gag* fluid.  Yes, you could use a chimney to accomplish this in about the same time and I have used a chimney for years.  But with a small child, dog, and dry conditions here in Dallas, the Performer's solution is so much safer.

The Performer cooks as well as any Weber kettle which is fantastic.  The work area is nice and the holder for charcoal is very clever.  I really can't imagine a better charcoal grill for the non fanatic.

I did have a missing part with my grill when I received it.  However, one call to Weber had the part to me in days.  It was a wheel so it wasn't a big deal -- I could assemble everything else.

Final disclosure -- I am a pretty big fan of Weber products.  When I bought this I had three other Weber grills.  I found that the Performer replaced both old standard Kettle and my Genesis gas grill.  The Performer is ready so quick that I just never used the gas grill any more.  Gave it to a friend and have no regrets."

It was a tremendous amount of water, the equivalent of a person sitting on a single crossbar. 
The reason EZ Up likely told the person they don't cover wind and rain damage is because in eight months, the thing had to have been rained on, and blown at.

But I did some modifications to get it in its present state:

The offset firebox arrangement: Using plain old charcoal will cost you a fortune! When I first got this as a Christmas present, I found this out quick! I went thru a whole 20 pound bag of Kingsford. Too costly! So what I did was to buy a propane tank and a propane burner. I ran the burner's metal intake connector out the Brinkman's air intake vent. Perfect fit! The vent also held up one end of the propane burner. Then I placed a regular brick inside the firebox to support the other side of the propane burner.

I now have all the heat I want, cheaply and also I now have pretty good temperature control! I also agree with another poster that the optional temperature gauge placed in the Brinkman's cutout is a waste of money and would be inaccurate. I did it and regret buying that thing. However do get a remote smoker temperature unit that gives you two separate temperature probes and readings. This way you can monitor both meat and internal smoker temps without opening the huge smoking chamber lid which would waste all your heat and smoke! And speaking of smoke...

...it drove me crazy figuring out how to make a sustained source of smoke that wouldn't snuff out the propane burner in the process! Here is what I did to solve this new problem:

Take off that ""Hobbit"" external smoke stack. Then take off the flimsy end cap that holds the swivel lid of the exhaust vent. With a drill, carefully make an 1/8 inch hole thru the welded on rod the end cap was attached to. Replace the lid. Now, take a tie-wire or maybe a cotter pin and put that into the hole you just made so that the swivel lid won't fall off as you invert it....

...invert it??? Yes, invert it. See, you will be stuffing hickory wood blocks into this inverted pipe. The part with the swivel lid will be placed directly onto the propane burner. The end of the smoke stack should be positioned into the smoking chamber. This way as smoke is produced, the smoke will go directly into the chamber NOT THE FIRE BOX which if it did would snuff out the propane burner! And speaking of hickory smoke...

...don't buy chips! It is too costly! Buy instead Hickory wood BLOCKS. I buy mines from Home Depot in large bags for super cheap! I use my small axe to carefully size the hickory blocks so that it fits snuggly into the inverted smoke stack. Works like magic. Oh, one more thing...

...place another Hickory wood BLOCK you carefully sized into the now stubby smoking chamber's exhaust pipe, where the smoke stack used to attach to. The wood block will block just enough so that most of the smoke stays inside the chamber and the wood block will allow just enough air flow so that the offset firebox's propane burner will get its air.

There you have it. The perfect smoker that is cheap to operate and effective at generating smoke! And don't forget to place a metal pot ontop of the propane burner that is full of water. You need this boiling to create the needed steam for your smoker's performance"

Items placed closer to the firebox do get MUCH hotter than those on the smokestack end.  This is probably my only complaint about this smoker.  This problem can be moderated somewhat.  You can create a makeshift baffle from aluminum flashing that will help some.  You can also put an aluminum drip pan full of water directly in front of the opening which will not only deflect some of the heat but introduce some humidity into the cooking section.  Personally, I just don't fill it up with meat.  If you're doing several slabs of ribs, use a rib rack at the far end. 

Airflow and temperature control were problems for me at first.  My particular smoker works best with the air intake vent completely closed.  This is not an air-tight smoker so it's still drawing air through the cracks in the door.  By keeping the fire low and the vent closed, the temperature doesn't climb over 250 degrees.  

Concerning the temperature--forget putting a thermometer in the space provided by Brinkmann.  It's too high on the lid and it will read quite a bit higher than the food at grate level.  Heat rises, you know.  I drilled a hole just above the handle and mounted a thermometer.  When I cook with the grates at the upper level, this thermometer reads just about right for the level of the food.  When I cook on the lower level, the actual temperature will be 30-50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads.  It's not totally precise but, hey, it's barbeque!!!

I've had this smoker for about 3-4 years.  I keep it under a covered area so it doesn't get rained on but the humidity in my area is always high.  I've had to repaint it once.  The firebox needs repainting now but that's been the only maintenance I've done to it.  I just clean out the ashes and the food drippings after each use and roll it under the covering until the next time.  Before each use, I line the firebox and the cooking section with heavy duty aluminum foil.  That makes clean-up a lot easier.  (What did we do before Reynolds?)

I don't smoke a lot with the Brinkmann.  Mostly I use a Weber kettle grill.  But every time I do a brisket or big roast or several slabs of ribs, I crank this baby up and it's never failed me yet.  Keep the temperature low, keep an eye on the fire and don't open the cooking section very often.  Just let nature, low heat and smoke do their job."

There are simply too many open seams to allow in air.  So... it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at 215f.  That said, with a bit of patience and practice, you can make excellent barbecue on this thing.

I purchased mine a Lowe's.  The grill has very good flame/temperature control and the side burner is excellent.  I grill on it seven days a week through the summer months and on warm weekends in the fall.  The heat is pretty even inside there really isn't any major hot/cold spots.  The side burner is nice since it comes with a non stick coated griddle for cooking.  I actually used this feature late fall during a power outage to cook eggs and french toast for breakfast.  The side burner without the griddle has a cast iron pot holder. The lid on the side burner is large enough you can close it when using smaller pots. Very useful on windy or chilly days.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this grill and I have had no rust or wearing issues with it.  The only drawback to the grill's design is the ignitor only works on the far left burner.  It lights the 3 burners from left to right. So If your only using 1 burner for a quick meal like hot dogs or hamburgers for 2 people you need to always use the left burner

Stinger: 
Pros- With mosquito lure, killed lotsa bad insects (at first, then wouldn't zap small insects!?)- BUT! 
Cons- Their electric wire grid uses square wires that QUICKLY clog up. Pretty soon it was packed solid & killing nothing! 
I had to keep blowing it out ( air compressor) every couple of 
days- HASSLE! 

Flowtron ""80!"" (took puny 40 back!)- 
Pros- Killed lots more bugs, because it NEVER clogs up (zaps small insects too!)! 
The electric rods are straight up/down, so no cross wires to catch falling insects & clog. 
Dead insects fall out the bottom- Blow clean once a month... 
I used the Stinger mosquito lure, purchased at Wally World... 

Cons- The only con is that the outer protective plastic cage HAD bars only about 1/2"" apart (same with Stinger)- This kept larger moths... from being able to easily get in to the electric grid. 
I used a large wire cutter & cut out every 3d bar- on top 2/3ds of cage- Alternating..., so cut bar was in the middle of two solid bars on adajacent side- Still rigid! 

I put it on an outside timer (for when evenings cool down- Not much insect activity below 55 degrees...). Adjust accordingly. 

Never hang it near a door, as their is always a 10'+ swarm of insects around it. 

Try to hang it over head high, in a DRY (electric) area."

Kern,"Lakewood, CO","I've had this weather station for about a month now.  It seems to get accurate readings - only if you can find a good spot for your remote sensor.  A bit of sunshine will make your readings higher than normal (outside).

A couple complaints:  as one reviewer said the buttons make the unit feel cheap, they feel clunky.  But, I only used them to get it all setup so its no big deal.  I've had some mixed results from the barometer.  When the actual pressure is mid-range its right on (i've chcked some readings from local airports to see how acurate it is).  But when a low or high pressure system moves in the readings are off more than I'd expect.  However the important thing is that you can see the pressure changing in the right direction.  Lastly, the forecasting model it uses hasn't worked for me...yet.  I live west of Denver, close to the mountains.  This probably creates a local weather pattern that the unit cannot predict.  I did not expect it to, but we've had some rain, snow, and fog that the unit claims it can observe and did not.  It's only been a month so I expect to see a prediction that is accurate at some time.            

Overall, I am happy with this product and think it is worth the money.  There were many other models I looked at and I think this gives the the most for the money"

Overall I am very pleased and glad that I didn't take the reviews too seriously. 

I found that the temperature accuracy seems to be fine; I put the base unit, external sensor, a second extra sensor, and my old Radio Shack digital thermometer all in the same location, and within a half hour they were all within 1 degree of each other, indicating to me that the temperature sensors are consistently acccurate. I also had no problem with the LCD viewing angle; it is adjustable and seems to have a wide viewing angle anyway so I haven't seen any need to adjust it.

One of my few complaints is that ALL external temperature sensors are shown on the display as ""outside"" temperature, where in reality I would think it's more likely that most users will place one sensor outside, and any extra sensors beyond that would be indoors (I could be wrong here). At first I was concerned that the forecasting function would be 'confused' by seeing several outside temperature/humidity readings that vary greatly, but eventually I found one sentence in the manual that indicates only the first external sensor is used for weather forecasting. So it's a little confusing but works fine as long as you make sure that external sensor #1 is truly outside temperature.

Another heads-up is that the base unit is larger than I imagined, and it looks pretty chunky sitting on my bathroom vanity. So be sure and read the dimensions"

If you put it close to a door, you can see the hole and the nail) and WALLA! in a few minutes, the clock sets itself! What could be more easy?

Clock is made of finely textured plastic on outside, but looks a lot nicer than in the picture. Great to match black, silver &/or designer computers, Black leather desk chairs, etc. in an office or computer room. Directions say to set it up late at night preferrably, and that if used in interior rooms of office buildings it may not be able to pick up the signal to set, and thus you'd do it manually. 

Clock is larger than it looks as well, which is easier on the eyes than other clocks. The price is certainly right as well. I bought an old black school-type clock for my kids when they were young, very similar to this one, and since my son took it with him when he moved out I wanted a replacement! (My mom bought the old one when my youngest was a baby, when my older child was learning to tell time. It's been through being dropped when moving, a few earthquakes and just keeps on ticking! I have the feeling this one will do the same as it's well made compared to many of the less expensive clocks out there - espcially the projection type, which I thought might be a great idea until I saw the reviews on how many different projection clocks simply don't work, are cheaply made, and a friend's daughter got one for her birthday, which didn't work either.)

You know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them.  They can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and, because of the 20 inch length, you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire.

I'm so very disappointed that this great grill is discontinued.

the smaller 14"" smokey joe simply does not have the depth between the charcoal grate and cooking grate to hold enough layers of charcoal to reach a consistent high heat. This is the only portable charcoal grill that does it. 

If you want a portable grill that's actually useful, this size is a must. I have tried them all. Smaller grills cannot retain consistent high heat, and you can forget about heating zones, indirect grilling with the smaller portable grills. 

What Weber may not understand is that many people have need for a good portable grill. City of Chicago, for example, forbid any charcoal grill on the porch. So we have no choice but to carrry the grill outside. Not to mention the big picnics, outdoor trips, parties in the park... small grills just doesn't do it. 

There's no open ash tray, meaning you can just shut the vents, snap the grill shut (with whatever in there) and wait 45 minutes, the grill will be cool to touch and ready to sit in the car - no worries about ash coming out of it. The charcoal can be reused next time. It's awesome.

I tried other brand portable big grills, and the design is so horrible, hard to clean, doesn't retain heat, etc. that just makes me miss this grill even more. 

I finally got this grill back after letting my friends use it for a couple of years. That's two years of abuse and it still looks shinny. I've missed this grill every summer since I parted with it, and I don't think I'll part with it ever again"

It takes very little space, and is easy to maneuver when cleaning time comes.

We took ours to a picnic this weekend and grilled two packs of hot-dogs at once (16 thick dogs). Because the grill is small, things get hot quick, and you will need to be careful with easy to burn foods that should take longer to cook. Burgers do well, steaks do fantastic. Chicken needs a a watchful eye.

I've used this gem for years. My apartments, on the whole, mandated the simplicity and efficiency offered up by the Smokey Joe. 

A great feature is the rounded top. This enables better smoking, as air and smoke circulates more fluidly. 

The downsides: 
The legs aren't as sturdy as they could be. Given time, a bit of bumping around and general abuse, and the screwed on legs might turn askew. If you notice this while the grill is hot, you've a problem. The solution is to keep them tight during nonuse. 

The air intake at the bottom gets clogged with ashes. A key to good charcoal grilling is the manipulation of air flow. The intake might be open, but stopped up. If you are diligent to clean the ashes, you'll be OK. 

Because the grill is so close to the ground, you need to be careful. Unlike most of Weber's grill, this one is also apt to getting kicked over, run into by dogs, cars and children. 

I fully recommend Weber's Smokey Joe. Now, I'm hungry. Time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats.

I have no problem putting 3, 4, or even 5 steaks on this grill with no problem. 
It's tight and well built.
The only thing I don't like is the kind of cheap side went covers. They come flat so they don't conform to the shape of the grill. You have to kind of form them by bending them around your knee or something and then they fit fine.

I give this grill 9 out of 10 Brats. 

EDIT, ONE YEAR LATER: They made a big mistake moving the vent holes from the traditional place on the bottom of the kettle to the sides. It completely changes the air flow and the result is a consistently cold fire. My three minutes per side burgers on the normal Webber are more like five or six minutes per side on this little grill. 
The bottom line is that this grill is ok for tailgating and camping, but I don't use it nearly as much as I thought I would and if I HAD to have just one grill, I'd get one of the other Webbers with the vents on the bottom. This grill has been a disappointment for me"

I just bought a new Weber Genesis 3 weeks ago (prior to the name change) after owning my last one for 11 years. There's a 3 burner model and a 2 burner model. If you're reading this you're looking at the 2 burner model.

Excellent product. 2 burners are more than sufficient; I don't know why they even have a 3 burner model since the 3 burner model isn't really that much bigger. The 2 burner model has plenty of room for the needs of everyday family grilling and entertaining a decent size group.

There's plenty of product info on this page from Amazon and the manufacturer, so let me tell you a few things that I do to make my Weber work best for me. 

-Most importantly...keep it covered. Amazon sells a cover...get it. Not coving it will cut its life in half at least. 
-Cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and THAT does not make a steak taste very good. 
-Change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink). 
-Get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...NOT after. The build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements. 
-Before each use, after you wire brush the grates, put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down. 
-Pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot. 
-Initiate cooking steaks, chops, any cuts of meat (even burgers...no, not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for no more than 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. This brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat. 
-Cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing). 
-Let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). This locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite), they'll run right out of your cut of meat. 

There you go. Hope that helps. And don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. Bon appetit!"

It seems to be relatively accurate with temperature, humidity and pressure readings, and the atomic clock sets itself every night.

I love having the sunrise/sunset times as well as the moon phase displays, And it's very easy to get that data for any city for any date without having to permenantly change the date or city on the unit. Very cool. I don't like the fact that the moon phase display is ""backwards"" - a full moon, in my opinion, should be a full white circle and a new moon should be a black circle. This unit shows the moon as black instead of white. But once you get used to this, it's no big deal. I really like the fact that all of the buttons are on the front of the unit. Some other La Crosse products have buttons on the back or other hard to reach places.

I have found a few problems with the design. There is a curved glass (or plastic) cover over the entire display that is very reflective. The reflections make it impossible to read across the room. In fact it's difficult to read standing right in front of it because of the reflections. It's best to stand just slightly to the right or left.

I was excited about the fact that the display shows the high and low temperature and humidity at all times for each of 3 sensors. However, I was dissapointed that you can't recall the date and time that the high and low was recorded, as you can with other La Crosse products. Also, when you reset the high/low, you have to reset all sensors at once instead of being able to reset each individually.

It can be challenging to set up 3 remote sensors, especially when you have more than 1 base unit, but it can be done (I also have a La Crosse alarm clock that projects the time and outdoor temp on the ceiling, so I wanted to get both units to read the same sensor as #1).

Although this may sound like a negative review, it's really not. The features and functionality of this unit far outweigh it's shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the features it provides. Make sure the dimensions fit your needs. It might be a bit large to sit on a desk - best to hang it on a wall. It also comes in oak instead of brushed aluminum sides."

As a result we have three clocks now that automatically keep perfect time, all synchronized, and all automatically adjusting for daylight savings time and standard time.  In the past, keeping three clocks in one room synchronized was impossible, and was made more difficult since these were 15 feet up on the wall.  The features of the temperature and humidity were an added bonus.  The price was about 25% as much as compared to other clocks our city was investigating.

The parsely and sage are from the new French Herbs kit. 

Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The sage grows very quickly and is more robust than even the basil.  The parsely seems to be slow but steady.  

Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal.

Basically, to set it up all you do is install a AA battery and press a button on the back of the clock to set your time zone (ET, CT, MT, or PT), the clock will do the rest overnight.  The reception of the signal appearently clearest during the night, according to the instruction manual.

Anyway, the next morning after hanging it on my wall the clock was in perfect synchronization with the time shown on my DirecTV satellite TV.  I live in the greater Seattle area and had no trouble receiving the atomic timekeeping radio signal from Ft. Collins, CO.  I'd rate this clock a 5 star buy.  The only slight downside is that the construction is inexpensive plastic (not metal), but then the clock would probably cost a lot more if it were metal.

Note: The manual warns that this may not work in the interior of a building.  Also, the clock probably won't receive a signal if you're inside a metal-framed building (such as an office tower).  Wooden buildings with lots of windows will work best, especially if you're far from Colorado"

Furst,"Salt Lake City, Utah","This is an attractive 10"" clock, white face, silver bezel (also available with black). The unique feature is the ability to synchronize with the atomic clock (WWWVB) in Ft. Collins, CO. Watching the hands speed around the dial as it initially sets itself is worth the price of the clock in itself. We bought one for a play room and liked it so much we bought two more.

After placing the battery, the clock begins searching for the signal. Generally it only takes a couple of minutes to sync, but it came take up to 24 hours. You need to set the time zone in which you live (Pacific, Eastern, etc). The clock automatically adjusts for DST (part of the WWWVB signal, apparently). If you live in areas of the country that don't recognize DST, there is a button on the clock to disable the DST offset.

Note that for the clock to receive the WWWVB signal, it cannot be in a shielded environment. We've had no problems in our home placing the unit in various rooms with an outside window, but I suspect it might not work in a windowless basement (in which case it functions as a regular clock). My company bought a ton of similar clocks, only to find that they cannot receive the signal in a windowless, steel building. Your mileage may vary"

Quist ""TCharlesMN""",Apple Valley,"There's really nothing more that can be said to further the reputation of this series of grills.  Those of us that own the Genesis E-310 series grill know how well this grill is manufactured, and just how very well it performs its duties.  It is, by far, the very best gas grill in this price range I have ever owned or used.  A couple of notes:
-The cross-over ignition system works wonderfully (it takes less than 3 seconds to fire up all three burners
-Those who say that their gas grill does not get hot enough to sear meats don't own this grill- I've had it up to 550 degrees on a very cold MN winter day
-That said, it seems to go through a good amount of propane when running all 3 burners on high...but that is probably obvious considering the temps you can obtain when running it on full.  (It will be interesting to see if I can get 500 + degrees to sear meats on medium setting on a summer day....).  The fuel gauge inside the cabinet is also a handy feature
-As always with this series of grills- No Flare ups, and the flavorizer bars do what Weber says they will, namely vaporize fats and juices into smoke that adds flavor to what you are grilling
-To keep this review balanced, there is one negative- I dislike the tool holders.  Although there are plenty, your tools pretty much have to have one of those leather hanging loop things to keep the tools from falling off or even to use the holders (a small price to pay I guess)

Finally, the Genesis E-310 I purchased came in a copper color, something I haven't seen on Amazon, or on Weber's site for that matter.  Maybe I missed it, or maybe I got lucky.  Either way, it looks pretty darn sharp on our deck when it isn't covered"

I have smoked several turkeys, many chickens, salmon, pork roasts....ALL with great success.  TWO things I can think of might help with your low temperature problem:

1.  Did you use an extension cord with it?  I once had the same problem you had when I used a long extension cord. Troubleshooting, I searched the manual that came with it and found that it says not to use long extension cords (you'll have to search your manual for the maximum optimum length).  PLEASE don't give up on your smoker!  I get much more  tender, juicy results than I do with my flambeed grilled meats!! ha ha!   The smoker is easy to use, no fuss and not too bad of a mess to clean if you line your water pan with heavy duty foil! I use Easy-Off oven cleaner on my two racks and water pan and be sure to rinse them very well.  I can leave for four hours and my food will be ready when I return (just be sure your water pan always has liquid in it)  When we have company, they LOVE the smoked flavor.  Hope this helps.  Once I eliminated the long extension cord, all was well.  
2.  Were you peeking at your turkey or basting it?  My lid also has a small gap through which the smoke escapes, but it doesn't affect it.  You cannot constantly open the lid to peek or baste as this allows the heat to escape and it will take a while for the smoker to reach the proper temperature again.  NO NEED to baste with a smoker! The meat is always juicy.

I found your review because after 14 years, I'm seeing rust on my smoker, which was one of the best of our wedding gifts.  I never owned a cover for it but always stored it in the garage when not in use.  This last year, however, it spent much time neglected outside (I have four children now) and I wanted to research smokers to find the replacement for our trusty old one! 

I would highly recommend a Brinkman electric smoker to anyone who is considering purchasing one (sorry, I've never tried another brand).  It's so much easier than grilling because you never need to watch over your food to prevent charring.  I guess you could say a smoker is to a grill as a crockpot is to an oven, except that unlike crockpot food, the meat will appear beautifully golden-browned with NO blackness."

 I have smoked  7 turkeys, alot of pork, and some beef all with really great results.

 I love that its electric. Regulating temp with charcoal smokers can be tedious. You barely have to do anything to it except add water and chips. It will maintain the ideal temperature of 220 degrees fairly well, But there are a few issues with this smoker:

1. Materials and construction- metal is thin and the lid fits loosely. The lid is suppose to fit loosely! There is no vent so it helps with the smoke. But because the metal is thin, on cold and/or windy days, it can be difficult for it to maintain it's temp on long smokes. Often runs 200-210 degrees.  This will increase your cooking time! On hot days it will run at 230- 240 degrees. Although I can't reccomend this modification to help with heat loss, I have actually heard of people fitting a electric water heating blanket to the outside of the smoker to help with this.

2. I wish the heating element was adjustable to help regulate the temp.

3. The door is small which makes it hard to add chips or water. Although you can take the unit off its base to add chips, this is akward and a bit dangerous since you may spill the water. It is nice to remove the base to help clean the unit though.

4. I installed an after market temp. gauge in the lid. (A must)

Overall a good entry level smoker that is super easy to use. Got mine at W-mart for $75. Anyhow, it's a great value for under a $100. Now after 5 years, it is about done and I need a new smoker. I will try to upgrade although after looking around at all the electric smokers, I might just buy another one of these. I love the ""bullet"" design of the vertical smokers.

 The stainless steel version of this model looks nice and is obviously made of better material, but the main section is attacted to the base. I do like being able to remove the base. Plus the element is still not adjustable. The only other choice is a  stainless steel meco smoker which has a better door design and a adjustable heating element, but is double the price. So I will either get this model again and do some modifications (temp gauge and maybe an adjustable element) or get the meco. Hope this review helps."

I also bought an inexpensive cover with elastic that works just fine.  Overall this is a good smoker.  Assembly took a while since the handles didn't match up with the holes on the smoker body and lid so I had to hammer at the handles a bit to get them to fit.  Otherwise assembly was easy.

The food thus far has come out great.  I have done salmon twice.  I was smoking in 30 and 40 degree weather and the fish took the normal 2 hour smoke time.  Once it was heated and smoking the temperature stayed between 200-250 degrees.  I'm sure it will do turkey breasts and brisket just as well also.

I would recomend this to anyone who wants a fair priced entry level smoker"

I didn't find out that amazon carried this brand until I went to the manufarturers website looking for the 10.5 quart fish cooker.  I haven't deep fried a turkey and probably won't.  My main use will be cooking brunswick stew and chili in large quantities for freezing and cooking fish and chicken wings.  I'm considering getting a wok.
  I am very pleased with this cooker and would recommend it to any one wanting to use this for the reasons I use it for.  It should also cook a turkey real well.  The aluminum pot (and lid) is very heavy gauge thickness and the burner seemed to have a great deal of heat.  The pot cleaned up just by spraying with the kitchen sink sprayer.  I had to keep turning down the burner to get to a slow boil on my stew.  A bottle of gass should last a long time.  The 30 qt. pot was half full at the time.  I can see how you could do some damage with one of these if you leave some oil unattended.
The burner had two loose phillip screws from shipping and I hand tighened those.  The stand and burner assembly are of sturdy construction.  Assembly instructions are well documented with photos.  I started to return for a cheaper model at Target but I'm glad I didn't.  It's a great cooker even though some folks were mislead by some ad listings.

I crunched through the tough, outer hulls, wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard, unopened shells, but then as I macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash, found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing.

When my wife came home, I mentioned to her how I was ripped off by the Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and, in fact, were barely edible.  My wife picked up the empty packet, looked at it for a moment, and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair.  ""You idiot,"" she said, ""these seeds are for planting.""  She then clobbered me with an antique, oak coat tree.  ""I don't know why I ever married you,"" she continued, ""you are always doing stupid, embarrassing things, and no matter how hard I hit you, you never learn.""

Since the price was only around $90 I figured it was the cheapest 'gamble' out there, so I bought it and put it in my backyard, which has been pretty much unusable since June due to the aggressive Mosquito population.

Sure enough, I have emptied hundreds of mosquitos out of the drawer in the 3 weeks I have had it installed.  My highest total in a day was 50.  My lowest total in a day was 3 when I decided to add an Octenol bait to this trap...which acted as a repellant as far as I can tell.  This trap definitely works better in the dark when the little blue lights show up better.

There are still mosquitos in my backyard, and I still get bit.  I think mosquito conditions are so bad that even after catching hundreds of them it hasn't had a significant positive effect yet.

One word of advice I would like to give...place this trap away from any area you want to use.  I moved it from the yard to my deck for a brief time, and it was a bad idea.  All the mosquitos from the yard were on my deck suddenly.  Yikes!

We are nearing the end of Mosquito season in Atlanta as cool Fall temperatures arrive, so it will be hard to judge what effect removing a few hundred mosquitos will have.  I am anxious to see how the Mosquito Catcher works next summer during the height of the Mosquito frenzy.

Wachsler ""m.w.""","Marietta, Ga","First of all let me say that there are some reviews that you should ignore, such as the one here that says that the Easygreen Sprouter is not a quality piece of equipment!   I'm a very fussy consumer and I can honestly say that THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING UNIT OF VERY HIGH HIGH QUALITY.  You can also do some Google searches and you will find nothing but raves about it and what high quality it is.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!
   Secondly, I'm starting to believe that everone should grow sprouts to get the vitamins that we are NOT getting from the food in our grocery stores. 
  As far as ""produce"" goes in our grocery stores, you may as well eat the boxes that they are shipped in!  Over and over in the media these days we are hearing them say that our soils are so depleted in the first place and by the time we get the veggies and fruits in our grocery bags they have lost what little nutritional value they had!  Even the organic stuff is questionable by the time it gets to our table, let alone the fact that some organic farmers are not really following the practices that produce nutritional food.  They may not be using poisonous sprays but are they replentishing the soil?  Ok- Enough of that!  You can find tons of info about that on your own. 
 IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FANTASTIC FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY  BUY ONE OF THESE SPROUTERS AND START GETTING THE NUTRITION THAT YOUR BODY BEGS YOU FOR! (No I don't work for them but wish I had designed it!)
 THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ADDITION TO THE WORLD OF NUTRITION AND A HECK OF A LOT CHEAPER THAN BUYING EXPENSIVE VITAMINS THAT YOUR BODY CAN'T ABSORB VERY WELL. We have spent thousands on vitamins over the years.   Who really knows what's in them anyway?  You'll know exactly what's in your sprouts though.  THEY ARE ALIVE A PACKED WITH EVERYTHING A VITAMIN PILL WISHED IT COULD BE BUT CAN'T!!  It's so so easy you won't even believe it.  It's fun to!
The sprouts are OUTSTANDING  and the cleanest most vitamin packed foods you will ever put in your mouth. Load up a sandwich or toss up a salad or throw some in a smoothie.  Don't forget the  Brocolli sprouts are GREAT!!
I use about a half a dropper full of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide each time I fill it with water every day.  (about one gallon)  This is perfectly safe and actually helps oxiginate the sprouts as well as prevent mold. 
I was so impressed with my Easygreen Sprouter that  I  ordered three more of these (actually called EasyGrass sprouters) and purchased a wheatgrass juicer so that I can grow wheatgrass, the miracle food.  (Check out Ann Wigmore ""The Sprout Book"" and her book on Wheatgrass )
 I can't say enough about THE EASYGREEN SPROUTER!!  Apparently people all over the world are catching on to this ""Fountain of youth"" piece of incredible equipment!  Do some Googling and see for yourself!"

That's good- a light bright enough to be seen during the day would be far too bright for night-time use.  You will be disappointed if you want to use this thing during the day.

I would have given this clock a much lower rating if I had intended to use the ""atomic clock"" feature, or to use it as an alarm clock.  Specifically:

1. The atomic clock only works in certain parts of the country.  The atomic clock broadcasting station is in Denver, CO, and the further away you get from Denver, the less likely you will be to pick it up.  We are on the east coast, and our house is on the eastern side of a large hill, and this clock has never picked up the atomic clock signal, despite following the instructions meticulously.  While it's possible we have a defective unit, based on what I've read I just think we're in a bad spot, and this unit doesn't have a very good antenna.  The good news is that the internal clock seems to keep fine time.

2. The physical construction is very, very cheap.  It is extremely lightweight, and easy to knock over.  The power cord connection is flimsy, and moving the clock (or knocking it over) will result in a loss of power (and your configuration if you don't have batteries installed).  The buttons are especially cheap, and poorly organized.

It works fine for our use because we don't need to touch it, but it would be terrible as a daily alarm clock- unless you are a lot more patient than I am at bedtime, you would not want to try to set this thing in a sleepy state of mind.  Unless you are a lot more coordinated than I am immediately after waking up, you would knock it off the nightstand regularly just trying to shut it off.  It wouldn't stand up long to such abuse.

But, as I said earlier- if all you need to do is put the time on the ceiling, it works admirably.

*UPDATE*: After using this thing for about 3 months, it spontaneously picked up the atomic clock signal.  I have no idea why (we didn't change *anything*), but it's been locked for a couple weeks.

Hall ""Robbman2000""",Des Moines,"I am not disappointed.  This grill cooks hot.  500 degrees within about 10 minutes.  In fact.  I've had the grill about a month and I think I've grilled 25 days of the month.  I need to watch it with all the meat but man I'm loving it.  It's so convenient.  My last grill didn't cook as hot.  It didn't leave the grill marks.  It didn't have the flavor of what this grill offers.  There is not much to complain about.  I dropped it while trying to put it together by myself.  I thought it was going to break my floor, not the other way around.  This sucker is tough!

I'm glad I didn't go cheap.  I can't afford $1000-$2000 for a grill so this was a good medium for me.  My last grill I paid $250 for.  It rusted in 2 years and the replacement parts cost almost as much as the grill so I dumped it.  I think I'll get my money's worth out of this Weber.

At this price even with the shipping it was cheaper to order online through Amazon than to buy local.  I consider this one of the smarter purchases I've made on Amazon.

**Bad side.  Has nothing to do with the grill but Amazon shipped it through a company named EGL or Eagle?  For a logistics company they sure don't know what their doing.  The delivery date kept changing and eventually it was a week later than the original estimated date.  They sent it from Reno to Sacramento to Chicago to Omaha and back to Chicago then back to Omaha.  From Omaha they hired two dudes and a truck to drive it to Des Moines where I live.  Once in Des Moines they called me while I was at work.  I met them at a gas station on the highway and lead them to my house.  It took about 20 minutes to find them because the one that spoke English was still new to the language.  No problem.  They were nice enough fellas but I'm just not used to going to get my stuff when I order from Amazon. 

I've ordered at least 50 items off of Amazon.  Normally I track it thru the internet and it shows up at my door.  In this case I had to call a freight company to get the status.  Then the directing drivers around business.  I guess this was a special order and maybe that's why they can sell it at this price."

When I looked at the Webers 5+ years ago, they were quite pricey and not knowing much about grills I said heck no! Well, live and learn. After replacing burners twice at around $70 each time and the Kenmore flavorizer bars at $40 all in 5 years, I decided to bite the bullet and spend the cash. After lots of research on lots of websites I went with the Gold B. So far it's been great. Warranty and quality is a lot better then the Kenmore and it should last a lot longer. My friend has had his Siver C for 9 years and it's still going strong! Delivery was quick! I ordered on a Monday and it was delivered on Friday. Setup was easy. Grill heats up very hot and quickly even though it's only 36000 BTU'S. I just ordered the rotisserie attachment for it and I'll provide feedback as soon as I try it out. This grill is now discontinued from Weber as they have new models out now. I got this on sale at Amazon for $466.00 on sale. I wouldn't pay anymore than that.

I've always been a bit of a charcoal snob, but I wanted to expand my repertoire beyond just the Weber charcoal grill and the Bradley smoker I have. 

It was a snap to put together and it only took me about 20-25 minutes. I was able to lift it onto the legs in step 3 by myself without a problem; you just need to be careful. 

I did a ton of research and opted for the Weber mostly because of my experience with their quality products and I didn't want to chance it with a semi-unknown brand from Home Depot. I chose the Genesis Gold as I don't necessarily like all the stainless steel framing in the genesis platinum line, but I wanted the stainless steel grates and flavorizer bars that the genesis silver doesn't have. Also, I wanted the B as opposed to the C as I don't really use the side burner.

It lights quickly and evenly and it does heat up in a jiffy; I do like the convenience of gas. I've also got a smoker box for the grill to add the smoke that I like to compensate for the lack of charcoal flavor. However, for low and slow true barbecue, I'll stick with my Bradley smoker as the water vapor from the propane as it burns doesn't allow proper penetration of the smoke into the meat. 

This grill rocks."

I was impressed that I didn't burn off my eyebrows (even though it was close). I was impressed that the simplistic heat guage's ideal, really meant ideal.

    * lemon pepper
    * cayenne pepper
    * garlic powder

on to the roughly 1.25 lbs of pork. I filled the water pan with a bunch of water, 4 cloves of garlic and a dash of port. I used some mesquite chips (thoroughly soaked) as my smoking agent and let it cook for 2 hours. The piece of meat came of with the most amazing flavor that I could imagine.

The drawbacks are that the black mesh screen needs to be stored somewhere else (there are no hidden nooks where you can stick it for easy access when you decide to light the fire) and it sits lower than your average table, so if you need to sit and use the table to work or read, it isn't going to work for you.  It is fine for eating casually, though.  There are little screws in the bottom of the legs so you can level the table without using other hardware and if you have an uneven surface like I do, you can move it around and adjust it easily to stop any wobbling.

I've used it so far to cook a pineapple upside down cake on coals and stew.  It worked very well, even without the usual camping legs.  This made in China pot has many minor pits and defects in the cooking surface but cooks well after two rounds of seasoning.  

Here are a few minor issues I had with the pot that caused me to give it 4 stars.  The lid has a loop handle that is really set up for a lid lifter.  Removing the lid with a pot holder is risky, since the lid is so very heavy.  The pot comes coated with wax to prevent rusting in shipment.  It is very hard to fully get the wax off, requiring several cycles of heating and soapy rinse.  The thin wire handles are the only secure way to lift the pot when full but its awkward and painful.  

The pot is great but the difficulty of the first cleaning has me looking at preseasoned pot for the future."

The projected image can be rotated and focused, and even without my glasses, I can read it in the dark (and my eyes aren't that good). It will *not* be visible when the room is lit. It is great to be able to read the current time and remote temperature in the middle of the night when you wake up. 

Out of the box, the radio-sync'd clock easily picked up the remote sensor (for another Oregon Scientific clock we have) on the back porch, and synched to WWV in Colorado within a few minutes. Over the last year, it has performed flawlessly, except for the time when we had to change the batteries on the remote, which required a reset of the ""mother ship.""

A tip: when you change the batteries on either the remote or the base clock, change both sets. If the unit does not show the temperature after changing the battery, reset it using a paper clip in the reset hole. I also have the LaCrosse projection clock in our other house, and this Oregon Scientific model is a superior product, I believe, to the LaCrosse equivalent"

Also stuff in your house can absorb the noise making them less effective - we are wall to wall stuff with 3 kids in a tiny trailer.  To effectively do our trailer would take 8 - 10 units.  Bugs that we do see are easier to catch and seem disoriented.   These buzzers are best used in wide open spaces with minor to middling bug problems.  The spiders and beetles and moths have totally disappered though.   Our dog hates the things when we move one over by her bed.   So, these units need to be moved every 2-4 weeks.  You need multiple units - 1 for every 200 sq. ft. at least - if you have lots of furniture or smaller rooms, then more - they don't work through walls or furniture.

Finally, authentic oriental cooking at home.  Highly recommended.
UPDATE:  Well, I've been using this for quite a long time now and I am even more pleased than ever.  I remember asking a Chinese chef in China town how come I can't make food like this at home.  He stated (in a heavy Oriental dialect), ""You gotta use hot wok.  Wok gotta be very, very hot!""  Yep, that's the secret.  You will never replicate authentic Oriental cooking on an ordinary gas or electric stove.  ""You gotta use hot wok!!"" and this devise puts out the BTUs for a very ""hot wok"" indeed"

Since I am a woodworker and live in Oregon, I knew ahead of time I would treat this chair so it will retain its color and last in the rain.  Any type of clear wood deck sealer will do and the TRICK to having a lasting chair is to place a small amount of ""liquid nails"" in each joint before screwing it all together (this chair does require assembly but it is EZ).  If you seal the wood and secure the joints, this chair should last many years.  I still love mine and they look great and because of the liquid nails...there are no creaks or movement whatsoever so I don't have to worry when my ""larger"" friends sit in them ;-)...buy them now...they are well worth it!!"

In order to get outside temp there is a remote sensor.  To be effective you need to mount it in a shady area with a screw.  Also the instructions suggest the more expensive lithium batteries (not included) for the remote sensor because alkaline batteries will only measure temps down to just below freezing, then the batteries freeze.

I do tend to keep the burners down low and turn the cover down on almost everything I cook.

But once it's done it's very non-stick.
An easy way to season:
Scrub the cookware using a green scrub pad and scouring powder.
Rinse well and wash with regular dishwashing liquid. Rinse again.
Dry in a 325F oven for about 20 mins. If you like, cool it a bit to make it easier to handle, but make sure to continue to the next step while the cookware is still warm to the touch.
Coat the inside and outside of the cookware with a good coat of vegetable oil--not so heavy it's dripping everywhere, but more than a thin coat. Of course use caution with the hot cookware. Put it on a few old towels and use a paper napkin saturated with oil to coat the pan. 
Bake upside down at 325F for 45min-60mins. You might want to put Al foil on the rack below the cookware to catch any excess oil that drips.
Repeat coating  the warm cookwarw and baking at least one more time. A third time is great.
After the final coat of oil is done, turn off the oven and let the cookware cool in the oven.
The cookware should now have darkened with a subtle sheen. The finish will be rock hard and smooth--not sticky at all.
Treat it well. I DO use diluted dishwashing detergent and a scruber to clean my cast iron and have never had a problem with the seasoning coming off. Just don't let it sit soaking in water for a long time. It will still rust. I let some friends borrow my lodge dutch oven for a campout. They let it soak overnight and scraped it to clean it and didn't dry it out well--the seasoning was chipped off. It came back rusted! So, I just had to scrub it out to remove the rust and redo the seasoning... It came back almost as before, except for the pitting caused by the rust--however, this is just a cosmetic thing. It still works fine.
Depending on how often you use the item, you can give it a touch up seasoning... just make sure it's clean and dry before giving it an oil coat and baking and cooling"

I was able to quickly set it up in my office; the instructions are simple and easy to follow.  My office is in a NYC commercial building, mostly made of mortar and brick with a steel frame.  Initially, I did not receive the signal in the day.  But the instructions pointed out that the signal is strongest at night, and the clock would most likely set at night.  Sure enough, the next morning, it was correctly set (even with the earlier daylight savings time).  I've found the black background with white numbers particularly easy to read from a distance.  My only concern was the same as that of other customers: Amazon packed it poorly, and the inner box holding the clock was totally free to bounce around in the outer box.  Fortunately, the outer box protected it enough, and the clock arrived unscathed.  Overall, I consider myself lucky, given the condition of many boxes delivered to my office building.

The first two times the glass was cracked and broken.

The shipping problems weren't the manufacturers fault though, as Amazon did the packing and shipping. It'd be nice if they maybe put a big ""Don't stack things on top of this box"" sticker or something on the box so that it didn't get damaged. Or, bubble wrap, remember that stuff?! Those airbags just ain't cuttin' it. 
On the clock itself, I love it. I kept it despite the minor denting b/c it has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and it's the largest atomic clock I could find that didn't have some ugly antique-ish design. The second hand actually ticks, instead of fluidly moving, which is a nice touch. It was easy to set up, and it's big and easy to read.

I bought this Detector several months back and enjoy it's relative ease of use, and it DOES find what you are searching for (coins, rings, earings, necklaces, etc). The other reviews here pretty much wrap it up as a good (affordable!) unit, but I wanted to make a few comments from an amateur's point of view:

- This detector has, of course, the discrimination circuitry used to tell the difference between the various metals helping you to avoid digging up junk like soda can pull tabs which are everywhere. It does work pretty good, BUT - I have found that by using the Tracker IV discriminator, you will most likely be missing some good stuff. I have gone back over ""Discriminated"" areas again in ""All Metal"" mode and found some nice stuff that Discriminate didn't catch. Granted I am no pro, but the fact is if you want to get every coin, every ring, or every cool item of various metals, you may want to consider just using ""All Metal"" mode. I almost exclusively use it now and although I sift through some absolute junk. I have found a bunch of coins, necklaces, pendants, etc that I would have otherwise missed. Use the Discriminate mode when looking for that gold wedding ring your wife through at you in the back yard...

- Invest in the 4 inch ""Gold Nugget Coil"" which is far superior at pinpointing metal. The stock coil works fine but is a tad ambiguous as to precisely where your coin, ring, (or pull tab) is. The smaller coil reduces search time and I am glad I have one.

- I bought the recommended Bounty Hunter Headphones (to save battery power), but have found them to be a bit more trouble than help. When I detect something I squat or sit down and dig. I set the detector down so the coil is near the dig zone so I can waive clumps of dirt (or sand) in front of the coil as I search. The problem is the headphone's wire tends to be always in the way when I perform this move. I get tired of ""untangling"" so I don't use them anymore. Maybe I'm just getting old.

- The meter is of no value for anyone who can hear the audible report. It has no ""range"" to judge metals you are passing over. It simply swings hard to the right no matter what from what I can tell. I have tried different modes and different metals to test it, but it seems to merely swing hard to the right as you pass over any type of metal / alloy. I can see how this would still be useful to a deaf person, but it just as easily could have been a bright light bulb instead of a meter. I won't ding this low cost detector for that though because I'd still dig if it was half scale or pegged.

- And lastly a warning. If you go into a park, or any area attended by kids, you will be spotted. Within a short amount of time you will be surrounded by kids ""helping you"" to dig up buried treasure. At that point you have to decide whether to be a meanie and bark at them, or write the rest of the hunt off and let them shred the area every time the detector beeps. I generally tell them how it's been a long day and ""see ya"" since they will invariably have their hands in there digging away no matter what you say..."

The coil is waterproof and can be used in shallow water, wet soil or sand which makes this a great beach detector. It's okay and recommended to drag the coil along the ground back and forth SLOWLY for maximum depth. It runs on only 2 9-volt batteries which by using headphones you can really extend the life of. While it doesn't have any visual target windows like more expensive detectors, the two-tone audio speaker is the key to determining what kind of metal you've found. You can literally turn this thing on and go! There's only 2 dials of operation to worry about ""all metal"" (a 10 o'clock setting is good) and it can be used in concert with the ""discrimination"" dial (11 o'clock is good here) to eliminate iron and other junk metals. It's simple enough for a child to use and understand.... To save the prospective buyer some trouble, read the manual carefully and practice around your house and yard before taking this into the field --- trust me. This is an ideal first detector for someone who isn't sure they'll like this hobby and don't want to spend lots of money to find out. Bounty Hunter also offers a 5-year limited warranty which shows you that they really stand behind their product. RESEARCH is the key to making good finds though, so don't expect great results without it! Read and learn all you can about your local area's history to improve your odds of success. Metal detecting has something big in common with real estate --- location, location, location is the key!"

My first detector was a Bounty Hunter QuickDraw II, a very fine, easy to learn detector that's a real workhorse. I learned most everything I know about metal detecting from personal experience and from reading lots of posts and asking lots of questions at the Bounty Hunter Forum http://www.detecting.com 

I shopped around and found the Bounty Hunter Land Ranger as a factory shipped model (no extras except 4"" and 8"" coil) for $337. For that price, I couldn't afford not to buy it! 

When the Land Ranger (LR) arrived, it was in 3 pieces and extremely easy to assemble. The manual that comes with the LR gives you the basic information you need to get started detecting with the LR, but is a bit general when it comes to explaining what each of the functions do. 

If you just want a ""Turn On and Go"" detector, the Land Ranger may not be for you. If this is the case, I would recommend getting an easier to learn detector such as the Bounty Hunter QuickDraw II or even the Bounty Hunter Tracker IV. Should you later decide to get the Land Ranger, your first detector will make an excellent back-up detector and a great detector for a friend or family to use with you. What I would recommend is going to the Bounty Hunter Forum website listed above to learn, way more, information about various detectors and their various functions than I could ever begin to explain here. 

Even though I had been detecting for a while, my first trip out with the Land Ranger was quite overwhelming and somewhat frustrating due to the much greater sensitivity of this model, the added features it has and an the information overload of tones responding to mineralized ground conditions, trashy areas (many pulltabs, screwcaps etc.) and a condition know as ""falsing"" (tones due mostly to incorrect ""Sensitivity"" settings and improper Ground Balancing). The initial experience that I describe here is very common with first time Land Ranger users and is frustrating, but will get much better with practice and with the more one learns about detecting in general and about the Land Ranger in particular. 

As I use the Land Ranger now, I have learned much about settings, what to ignore and what to watch for to indicate which targets may be worth digging. Once past the information overload (that will happen, I assure you), the user will begin to appreciate the sensitivity of this detector, learn the proper settings, begin finding more and more valuable items (or targets as they are called) and become one with this detector. 

I purchased the Bounty Hunter Land Ranger for it's very sophisticated microprocessor features including - Target Id, VDI (numeric) readout indicating target conductivity, 3 Tone ID, it's automatic & manual Ground Balancing, Programmable Target Accept/ Reject, All Metals, No Motion/ Pinpoint mode, Self Tuning (Motion) All Metals Mode (good for deep hunting of Relics, Caches and/or gold nugget shooting) ... And ... for the reputation of Bounty Hunter Detectors ... but MAINLY for the excellent price of such a full featured, professional metal detector. 

I love being able to put this baby to work discriminating out trash items while ringing in sharp and clear when locating coins and jewelry. The Land Ranger is also ideal for hunting Relics and for (gold) nugget shooting, although I have not done much of either of these yet (soon, I hope). I also love the fact that two coils (standard 8"" and 4"" nugget coil) come stock with the Land Ranger and I also have a 10"" coil that I purchased for around $60. (it's important to have several coil sizes available for various types of hunting) The price of additional coils for many other brands of detectors is astronomical, so this was an integral part of my decision to get a Bounty Hunter rather than some other brands. 
I love how lightweight this detector is. I love knowing that I have a sophisticated detector that will not miss items that are buried deep. (how deep depends on the size of object, type of metal, soil conditions etc) Generally, the LR will detect to a depth of around 10""-12"" deep for a coin sized target. (believe me, you won't want to dig too many objects THAT deep, most targets are right around 4""-6"" deep, due to how coins, jewelry etc. tend to migrate down into the soil, this varies, of course, but in general, a greater number of objects are somewhere in this depth range. 

What I hate about the Land Ranger is that parts of the manual give a very general description of certain features like the ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode. I wish that the Land Ranger were waterproof or at least water resistant ... 
it is not, and I highly recommend that you do not use it in the rain without a good plastic cover that fits securely around the control housing. 

In Conclusion: 

I highly recommend the Land Ranger for any seasoned detectorist ... or for a novice detectorist that is willing to devote a good deal of time and a fair amount of patience to mastering the many nuances of this full featured detector. The Land Ranger hosts Target ID, (VDI) Numeric Readout, 3 Tone ID, Depth Meter, Battery Meter, Ground Monitor Meter, Sensitivity meter and Target indicator. It has Touchpad controls for Sensitivity, Accept/ Reject Discrimination, All Metals - No Motion/ Pinpoint mode, 3 Factory Preset modes, All Metals (Motion) Self Tuning mode and for Smart Trac Automatic and Manual Ground Balancing. 

It's a handful, but a great full featured unit for a very reasonable price. 5 stars ... Highly Recommended if you are willing to devote some time and patience in learning it's traits and harnessing it's potential, once you do, you'll absolutely love it, I know I do!

At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long"

Kay Stone,"Avon Lake, Ohio USA","This is a very nice looking and sturdy table.  A nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch-up paint with the product.

The table may look nice now, but getting there was a pain in the neck.  On the positive side - it is very well packaged.  No worries about any damage during transport - not a small issue for many items.

That said, the instruction sheet included was for a different (rectangular) table with completely different legs.  Even if it was for the same table, it was in that hard-to-understand translated-into-English-using-a-dictionary vocabulary.  There was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers, as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts.  Unfortunately, there were 12 bolts in two sizes and 12 washers - but 16 holes waiting for bolts in the table.  All of the bolts were too long for any of the holes - even with the washers.

I ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store (if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem).  The bolts provided required between 3 and 4 washers each before they could be adequately tightened.

Whew - finally done.  The table is serving us well on the patio.  It replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall.  The open weave design is nice - very easy to clean the top.  Give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and I might give it 5 stars"

It generates a lot of heat! This is a mixed blessing as it gets a good boil going, but I found it a little bit difficult to control the heat (getting it to slow down enough to not over boil).  

For my own use, I run it with the lowest amount of air/gas available (lowest flame), but if you are in need of serious heat or doing some serious outdoor cooking this burner does the job!

Pros:  Lot of flame, easy to use, easy to setup.
Cons: Little difficult to control the heat as the lowest setting still runs a bit hot"

For what you get, it's an excellent value - and I have found it reliable and a joy to use. 

That said, I echo the comments about the wireless features, and installed my unit as a wired system. I wanted to avoid having to change batteries on sensors mounted in difficult to reach areas. I also found out that the system, particularly the rain sensor, is RF sensitive. As a Ham Radio operator, I found a 10 watt 2M transmitter 15 feet away caused errant readings. To solve this, I did two things, I moved the 2M antenna and I added several wraps on ferrite cores for the telephone cables that connect the sensors and the main unit. 

After reading the documentation on the Heavy Weather software supplied with the unit, I decided I was looking for a more complete package and purchased Weather Display. This interfaced perfectly with my WS-2310, and has resulted in a reliable and accurate system. You can see my weather system online at http://bwusa.homeip.net:14501/info.html. I also feed data to WeatherUnderground and other systems. 

In all, there is no doubt that there are more rugged systems available, but they are far more expensive, which would have made my project impossible"

It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.

All that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench).

Bassett,"Raleigh, NC, USA","I am amazed. My mom sent this to me after I'd complained about already being eaten alive by mosquitos this year. I don't just get bites; I get huge, oddly shaped, so-itchy-they're-almost-painful, welts. And I am that person who attracts every single biting insect. I have often wished that I sweated DEET. However, I don't.

I tried this dubiously, first in the morning--I'd been getting bites every day between 8 and 10am (even with high % deet). --No bites.-- I still didn't believe it. I used it again that evening--after a rainstorm had come through--from about 6pm to 10pm. No bites! It comes with a belt clip, but I left it outside at one point when I came inside. The second I left its side, a mosquito landed on me.

I have, since then, used it several more times, no insect spray at all, and it's been very muggy around here. Absolutely no bites. I have seen a couple more bees than usual, and it turns out that the ingredient this blows out (geraniol) is said to attract bees. Not a big deal to me.

It apparently doesn't work for everyone. I have always assumed that there is some sort of chemical I give off that makes mosquitos head straight for me, bypassing everyone else. (I might be at a party where no one else even sees a mosquito and I leave with over a dozen bites.) I wonder if the geraniol somehow combines with whatever it is that I put out and neutralizes it. This could explain why it would work for some people and not other people.

At this price, it's worth it to find out if you are one of the people for whom it might work! I figure if I replace the cartridge every 2 weeks (~$3.50/cartridge), I will even be saving money because I'd been going through 1-2 cans of high-deet bug spray per week"

The geranium scent is rather strong, but not unpleasant.  I don't find it necessary to leave this on all night, so it's not a problem.  I also like that you can clip this on your belt and turn it on for when you are outside.  It's just a tiny little fan blowing through the geranium scented cartridge, so it is small and light-weight"

You can mount this handheld remote temp sensor anywhere outside - and it sends the temp via radio signal back to the unit in your bedroom. It is amazingly easy to set up - and the weather forecaster works like a charm. I just can't say enough good things. This is a well made clock that serves many purposes and is super easy to use.

Atomic Clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough -- there is often about a 1-2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other, but this is minor for the uses we get out of it (a quick look at outside temps during the winter).

The only issue we ran into that was ""problematic"" was the Ice Alarm feature.  This feature sets off the devices alarm anytime the temperature drops between 32 and 27 degrees or so to alert you to possible icy conditions.  The problem is that in cold climates the temperature hovers in that range all winter long...so the alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so.

We just happened upon a solution that has worked perfectly.  The ice alarm only works on Channel 1.  So, if you set the outside sensor to Channel 2 or 3 the ice alarm is disabled and is no longer triggered.  Obviously, they should have an ability to shut it off, but this is it...and even this isn't listed in the instructions"

I guess I can keep screwing the propane tank on and off, but that's such a pain and the soapy water is messy!

First roast turned out well, but in Winter, California, 60 degree weather it took a little longer than expected (2.5 lbs beef and it was edible/medium 160 degrees internal in about 3.5 hours and two rather large handfuls of apple chips soaked for 24 hrs).  The flame blew out three times and scared me because I wasn't watching it the whole time, and when I thought of propane exploding upwards!  I didn't think it would go out so easily, so I just ended up feeding it more gas and tried to cut the intensity of the heat using the air intake adjustment.  

You have to add more chips to get a lot of smoke flavor so that is easy, but you have to lift the whole body up and off including the water pot and meat, which could get heavy, but at least you can keep the lid on and keep some of the heat in there.  A good thing about this design is that if you are doing charcoal, you can replace the charcoal quickly.

Overall, I'm very excited, but I had those couple gripes...no door to access the water pan and no way to access the coals without lifting the whole top off and no easy way to remove the propane for safety.  I love the ease of having a gas option as you have to have the patience of a saint to tend to my other charcoal smoker as it didn't have a way to get rid of the ash to keep the temperature even and accessing the coal bowl was really a pain, especially if you wanted to add HOT glowing charcoal.  

I'm pleased though!  I got this one for my birthday as a gift to myself since I always wanted a gas grill for instant gratification.  I do love charcoal briquettes and chunks as well, so I'm pleased I still have that option.  Read the owners manual thouroughly before purchasing so that you don't have any surprises.  You also need adjustable wrenches or specific sizes (I used two crescent adjustable wrenches) to put it together, but it went together fairly intuitively and quickly"

B0007ZGUKC:great_product:d._henry,B0007ZGUKC,Steven Raichlen Best of Barbecue SR8018 Potato Grill Rack: Outdoor Living,outdoor living,1 of 1,4.0,Great product,"January 9, 2007",D. Henry,"Fort Worth, TX USA","While the principle of the product is rather simple (a flat piece of metal with spikes sticking up), it is very useful. The instructions are very easy -   coat with a light coating of oil, and drop the potatoes on the metal spikes.  Stick on BBQ and cook. Allegedly cooks faster than potatoes would in an oven.

Here are my reflections after my first time using this contraption:

1) I started cooking potatoes at the same time as the steak and vegetables. By the time my steak and asparagus were cooked, the potatoes needed another 10 minutes or so. In hindsight, I should have started the potatoes while the grill was heating up; and they would have been done on time

2) I varied from the original instructions - wrapping two of the four potatoes in aluminum foil before placing them on the spikes. They cooked faster, though had less of a roasted taste (that I found very desirable!)

3) On one of the four spikes I placed a sweet potato - which tasted fantastic after coming off the grill! It needed no foil, and cooked a little faster than the exposed (foil-free) potatoes.

In summary, you should probably start cooking the potatoes while the grill is heating up. You can wrap them in foil to make the job faster; though it will cut back on the nice roasted flavor that you otherwise get.

I gave it 4 stars because it isn't 100% non-stick, even with a coat of oil. When I pull potatoes off the rack, they tend to stick to the spike and tear that part of the potato open. Still taste great, though"

Rabi,"Iowa City, IA","There are two ways to measure the quality of an insect zapper. First, how powerful is it light? That will determine from how far away insects will be attracted. Second, how powerful are its ""shocks""? That will, of course, determine what happens to the hapless critters. The Flowtron BK-40D performs both of these admirably.

This should be set up AWAY from your seating area - at least 10 yards. It will attract and kill so many insects that if it is near you, you will get covered. Also, the zapping noises it makes as it kills can be intimidating to young kids.

The plug comes off a short (6 inches or so) wire from the top as it hangs down from your pole. Make sure whatever extension cord you use is rated for outdoor use.

There is a compartment just below this model, which will fit a sticky mosquito attractant - one comes free with this package. You can get refills easily at Target or WalMart. Cost about $4. You probably will not need them, however, because the UV light does a good job of attracting insects.

I recommend it fully"

This unit works very well in every way, a basket mesh kind of food holder would be a good option, use a drip pan and keep the coals off to the sides, the ring riser/extension is useful for smoking and cooking big things, etc. It is all good, but there is more:

Who do you know who actually has a charcoal grill and a rotisserie? Nobody. If you get one, your guests will be entertained on several levels and you will be the Master. A rotisseries is professional looking, produces unmatched taste and an exciting demonstration-style cooking experience for everyone. Those that utilize them are seen as proficient and competent. Not a bad label for you, eh? Might get you somewhere.

The best meal I ever had was a rotisserie turkey that saved me from starvation after a Hike of Death. Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.

Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat, short cooking time technique. Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here. One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way. This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.

Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret. A turkey, for example, is best taken out of the heat at around 170, or less, and allowed to rest. It will go up around 10 degrees after that. 

I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals. Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic. Other things could be used, too. I have rotisseried heritage, free range, organic, kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good. 

Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything, and prevent lawsuits of course. However, fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it. Use a separate thermometer, not the supplied pop-out sensor. I am no professional, but I can say it produces the best tasting food."

At first I put them both in the basement where I had actually seen the little critters (I have a pretty big house) and I didn't see any evidence of them in the basement after two days or so but upstairs it was still: little poops all over, chewed cereal bars in the closet/cupboard, mice in the trash can etc.  So I moved the ""pest repellers"" upstairs and put all my food items in plastic containers.

The coated handle NEVER gets hot and the overall shape is long enough to reach deep into a grill without scorching your hands.  An instant favorite at our house

Anderson ""Building Inspector""","Sunrise , Florida","Another gadget I had to have.  The best thing about this is the ease of finding the outdoor temperature at night.  It clearly is shown on your ceiling but not distracting when trying to sleep.  You can be just laying there and all you have to do is open your eyes and there is the temperature and if you want you can have it also show the time of day.  The temp and time appear alternately every few seconds.

During daylight hours you cannot see this on the ceiling but you can look at the devise and it will have the same information.  The time is kept in sinc with the atomic time via over the air electronic signals. 

For the price, I reccomend this little toy.

I have found that the outdoor receiving device does need to be located in an area that does not get direct sunlight.  The estimated temperature can be way off when the sun is in a position to affect the receiver, so proper positioning is important"

As far as the grill press itself goes, I couldn't be happier with it.  I used it with Steven Raichlen's Tuscan Grill and it produced very distinctive and flavorful grill marks on steak.  It is great for grilling  butterflied chicken too.  In fact, it is so good with chicken that I might have to have a second one!

It will rust if not properly seasoned.  To season the Grill Press, remove the handle by unscrewing the two screws on either end.  Rinse with mild soap and water, then thoroughly dry.  Rub cooking oil over the entire surface with a clean rag or a paper towel.  Place it in an oven preheated to 250 degrees fahrenheit for approximately 2 hours.  Handle with care when removing, as the Press will be quite hot.  Use a hot pad.  Let the Grill Press cool on a heat resistant surface, replace the handle, and then store as usual.  Because cast iron is porous, each time you use the Grill Press following the initial seasoning more oil will seep through from foods and enforce the waterproof oil bond.  The Grill Press should not be left in water and is not dishwasher safe.  Rinse the press under hot water after each use and dry immediately by blotting water droplets with a towel.  If directions are properly followed, your Steven Raichlen Cast Iron Grill Press should last for years."

Instructions are OK but could use some more close ups. So here is the trick I found that wasn't mentioned. It is best (the only way I could get things connected at all) to put the ""cap"" (like a fancy nut with a flange) in the slot first and then feed the bolt into it. That bit of information would have helped a lot. I ""do"" put lots of things similar to this together so not a complete novice. 

The other - a bit more major problem - was that one leg of the chair appears to have denser wood or the pilot holes were not drilled correctly. So no matter what I did on one side I could not get the final SCREWS (there are only four as other connectors are bolts with end caps) in all the way and came close to permanently stipping the hex bolts. The answer is to drill longer pilot holes but I need someone with a drill to do that so it will be down the line.

I also agree that it is not very comfortable without a thick cushion like the type that goes on lots of outdoor furniture.

So a good product and better than some ""put it together yourself"" but not perfect. It seems very sturdy but as another reviewer stated it is too soon to tell the longevity of the product"

The unit seems well made and the display is easy to read. Based upon my experience so far I would still buy one but the design/implementation could certainly be improved.

1 - The remote distance of 80' is line of sight under perfect conditions. The manual suggests to deduct 20-30 feet for an external wall. If there wasn't an external wall it wouldn't be outdoors now would it?

2 - The time of day is only updated once a day at/near midnight. My unit is off by 2 seconds by noon. Not a big deal but one would expect a bit more accuracy.

3 - The algorithyms for computing the sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset seem to be off a couple of minutes when compared to values from Intellicast, etc.

4 - The temperatures and humidities seem accurate compared to other measurements I have.

5 - Even though it has a 'rain cap' the external sensor must be out of direct rain fall such as under the eaves.

6 - The oak trim is just a vinyl decal on plastic. Nobody is going to confuse it will real wood.

He made an excellent chicken with it last weekend.  It provides a nice sturdy base to set your chicken on and allows you to add veggies, beer, wine, etc very easily.  I was very impressed on how it held and chicken and the ease of removing the chicken once done cooking.  We have a very cheep ""beer-in-the-butt"" holder and the Weber Roaster was much more stable and easy to use.  I do not give it 5 stars because it set the chicken so high, the lid to my fathers Weber Charcoal Grill would not fit.  However, he was able to rig a smaller grill rack to sit lower in the grill and it cooked fine.
We had great chicken"

As ever, the goal was simple: Club Chairman Solun Fangtooth (my neighbor, Glen) took thine replica One Ring, authentic down to the Mordor Elvish inscribed around the band, and hid it in yon forested creek behind his parents' abode. The five new members of the cabal, myself included, would comb the wilderness in search of this mighty treasure. He who was first to unearth Sauron's golden band of evil would be promoted from rank of Hobbit to the Council of Elrond, and get to choose the location for our next screening of all three LOTR films.

The rules of the hunt are simple: any method is allowed, provided it can be justified as the tactics and materials of a fantasy character.

 The other four fledglings, cloaked in robes of Rivendell and carrying Torches of Truth (in the form of flashlights), scoured the wooded gully, seeking some minor clue of Fangtooth's passing. But having shared a road-trip to ComiCon with Fangtooth, I knew him to be a wily foe - it would take wits, not persistence, to uncover the location of the One Ring.

To this end, I unsheathed mine ultimate weapon: the Bounty Hunter Quick Draw II Metal Detector. A gift from my patriarch for the passage of boyhood to man, I had honed my skills at alloy retrieval on the sands of Hilton's Head. Finding 64 in Coins of the Realm, I knew the path to advancement lay in the probing waves of this device.

Setting the proper adjustments to compensate for uninteresting metallic flotsam (nails, etc.), I knew the rhythmic beeps of the Quick Draw II would lead me to victory. In practiced, methodical sweeps of the search coil, I combed the creekbed, finding the One Ring in a shallow pool, partially buried in the silt. Victory was mine. My own.

Of course, there were protestations at my ingenuity. Some argued that the technological marvel of the Quick Draw II was outside the boundaries of our club charter. However, I deftly explained that the very name of this product led me to adopt the perfect fantasy persona: I was a bounty hunter - one who used any means necessary to achieve his goals. I was Bilbo Fett!"

At this size, it's strictly a grill -- you won't offset-cook on this. 

A note: Weber grills are made to be used with the lid on, always. If you cook without the lid on, you lose temperature control, the fire often gets too hot and you get the old burned-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside syndrome. With the lid on and the vents in use, Webers are the best charcoal grills at temperature control in my experience...although the smaller the grill, the harder it is.

I think Weber still makes the slightly larger version of the Smokey Joe -- one with an 18.5-inch grill. That will give you a lot more flexibility while still being very portable. It's possible to offset-cook chicken for two on an 18.5-inch grill but probably not on this one.

And finally, this is not for use on your apartment balcony. That's illegal in most places and most assuredly dangerous. Even if you have a concrete balcony, sparks can waft away from your grill and set something else on fire"

Plus the readout is backlit and it has a light to help when grillin at night.  The only negative is that it is not water resistant so you have to be careful washing it.

Assembly is not for the light-hearted, but the biggest problem was the assembly instruction sheet.  Not very clear, uses ""beside"" where it should say ""inside""; makes no mention until 3/4 of the way through that there are different lengths of screw, and does not differentiate between regular and sheet metal screws.  However, I had no real problem, but assembly does take 1 1/2 - 2 hours.

I thought the construction was quite good.  Certainly nothing is much stronger or heavier than it needs to be, but this means that the grill is no heavier than it needs to be!  When assembled everything feels very solid.  I did take the wheels off and reinstall them after completing the frame so that I could tighten all screws when the frame was fully assembled and squared.  Probably not necessary, but it only added about 30 seconds.  Next time I would delay installing the wheels for a few steps.

I give five stars because I do not know of another grill in this price range that is as large, has so many features, and cooks so well"

For one thing, there is no Index, nor Table Of Contents.  I have spent about an hour trying to figure out how to engage the alarms for outdoor High Temp, etc., to no avail.  I guess I am just not hitting the right buttons, or leaving them depressed long enough.  I WAS able to calibrate the barometer to match my wall-mounted barometer and I have to admit - it works VERY well.  I enjoy too the barometric histogram, covering the last 36 hours.  

Because the booklet doesn't explain, I am still trying to figure out what the percentage factor of the ""Forecast Index"" really means, and why it sometimes is presented as ""12 hour forecast"", and other times it is 24 hour forecast.  

Because the outdoor sensor is not waterproof, it becomes a bit of a challenge in locating the device to where it will be protected from rain, and direct sun exposure, etc., and yet be out in the open for a true reading, so as to not be influenced by warmth radiating from the house.

Self setting function works exactly the same on all of them. So I think it's worth setting the expectations straight for how this clock will most likely work for you. Unless you live close to Colorado (where the time signal originates) the proper way of 'setting' this clock is to put the battery in and wait overnight for the clock to set itself. Best signal reception depends on where you live and also on time of year and weather conditions. In Charlotte, NC where I live - most of my atomic clocks and watches sync themselves around 2 am. I guess it's a bit confusing to people unfamiliar with the 'atomic' technology to see the hands of the clock start moving around and then stopping at some random hour as if though the clock was broken... La Crosse (and other makers) should probably include a 'quick start' card that states in big bold letters to put the battery in, select your time zone, IGNORE any hand movement (or lack there of) and then WAIT overnight. Again - unless you live close enough to CO so that the clock can receive time signal any time of day or night - you will have to wait until the next day.

I've had this clock for around 6 months now and it worked perfectly well (to within 1 second of actual time) with the exception of a couple bizarre quirks. One time the clock got itself off by 15 minutes (though the seconds hand was dead on). I did not adjust it - and the next day it fixed itself through its usual overnight self-setting. Another time it spontaneously changed time zones and started showing California time. This time around I had to remove the battery, reinsert it and re-select the time zone (simply re-selecting time zone did not solve the problem).

As another reviewer remarked - the clock looks nicer 'in person' than it does on the photos. The very thin rim makes the dial look a bit bigger than the stated dimensions would suggest. Face color is off-white or very light cream and looks very nice. As for the build quality - it's nothing special. The clock is 100% plastic (even the 'crystal') except for the dial which is simply paper. The whole thing - including mechanism - is made in China. Even though the clock is probably extremely cheap to manufacture (given its all plastic construction) it does not LOOK 'cheap' once it hangs on the wall. I bought a virtually identical quality atomic clock for seven bux (delivered) on everybody's favorite auction site and it looks OK - but not as nice as this one (a different 'brand' - not La Crosse).

One star taken off for the 'quirks' - but  not for the 'good enough' materials engineering (it would be better if it was made less cheaply - but it looks fine the way it is).

M. Bean,"West Palm Beach, Florida","What a great clock.  I was more than pleased with this purchase.  I was looking for a clock to put outside (I live in south Florida) on my pool deck so I could tell the time without having to either go inside in my wet bathing suit or take my watch outside. This clock is suitable for outside or inside use.  There is a twist off cover on the back of the clock over the mechanism to help make it weatherproof.  I installed it under cover of the eaves to give it some protection from the weather.  No tools are required to install the battery.  It takes one AA battery.

Not only is this clock very attractive, it keeps absolutely perfect time because it sets itself by the atomic clock in Denver at least 6 times a day.  I was most impressed when daylight savings time ended in October and the clock set itself BACK an hour during the night and was perfectly on time the next morning. 

On the back are 4 buttons for setting the time zone.  Simply push the button for your time zone to tell the clock where it is. All I did to set it up was install a battery and set the switches and hang it on the wall.  It did the rest.

As an added plus, it has an analog hygrometer (% relative humidity) and an analog thermometer that appear to be very accurate as well.  

I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it as a stylish addition for either indoor or outdoor use"

Jones,,"I like this clock. This is a night stand alarm clock. And it does what it is supposed to do very well once it is set up.

The set up is not intuitive so you HAVE to read the manual and do exactly as it says. But it is not really hard to set up it's just not easy. You have to think about what you are doing. By the way the manual is large as another reviewer commented but it's because the instructions are in several languages not because it's so complicated.

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the plug which the AC adapter plugs into, which allows it to project the time continually, has too much space on either side. The result is that you THINK the AC adapter is plugged up properly when in fact the adapter has gone down on either side of the plug. It took me a while to figure out what was going on. At first I thought the clock was defective as some of the other reviewers did. That's a bad design flaw that needs to be fixed.

FYI it doesn't project the time continually in battery mode because that would quickly drain the batteries. In battery mode it only projects the time for about 3 or 4 seconds when you press the snooze button.

Once the clock is set up for your time zone you never have to set the time again, not even for daylight savings time, and you always have the correct time. The clock has a built in antenna that picks up the radio signal from the official U. S. government time keeper. Once a day it sets itself according to that radio signal. It also has sensors that tell you the indoor humidity and temperature."

Has Mister, Watering Timer: Outdoor Living",outdoor living,3 of 3,5.0,Amazing machine!,"January 27, 2007","C. Laliberte ""Mystique""","Alberta, Canada","This EasyGreen automatic sprouter is an amazing machine!  I had used the jar method with mixed results.  My busy schedule prevents me from being able to attend to sprouts as needed.  I decided to invest in an automatic sprouter.  I am very happy with this unit.  It was a good investment.    I personally feel that it is worth every penny.  

The set-up was easy, thanks to the clear directions provided in the manual.  It is very well built.  It allows you to connect several units together if you wish to expand its sprouting capacity.  It is made of a few components which can easily be replaced when they wear-out without having to purchase a new unit.     

The unit is connected to a timer (provided) which activates the mist generator for 15 minutes at a time.  I followed their suggestion to set up the timer for 7:00am, 10:00am, 1:00pm, 4:00pm, 7:00pm, 10:00pm and 2:00am.  This has produced wonderful results!   You can set the timer to a different schedule if you wish.

I put my automatic sprouter next to my kitchen sink which makes drainage very easy.   I had to fill the 5 liter reservoir manually every day until I decided to purchase the Automatic Water Filling System (AWFS).  This accessory can easily be added (you have to purchase it directly from EasyGreen).  It makes sprouting even easier than before.  

The unit comes with one big tray (for sprouting a great quantity of one thing) and 5 smaller elongated trays that can be used together(each tray grows about 2 cups of sprouts)  I put seeds in tray #1 and put it in the growing compartment of the machine.  The next day I seed tray #2 and put it in the compartment next to try # 1.  So on and so forth with each of the 5 trays.  On the 5th day, tray #1 is ready to be harvested.  I then re-seed it and put it back in the machine.   I also sprout beans and greens which have a different growing period.  (I keep track on a piece of paper of the type of sprout I am growing in each tray and what day it will be ready for harvest).  This unit basically allows you to sprout something different everyday.   

The EasyGreen gives you the option to sprout hydroponically or in soil.  I have not tried the soil option yet.   

I am totally impressed with this unit and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing an automatic sprouter"

It had several features my wife and I insisted upon in our next grill, namely stainless steel grates, 3 burners, and a stainless steel finish. All in all, it has done marvelously in cooking everything we've tried from steaks, chicken and fish, to a full 30 lb. turkey. That bird came out perfect! The three controls are easy to use, the lower storage compartment is roomy, and all the parts are made with quality in mind. My only complaint is the arrangement of the burners, which are top to bottom (or, front to back, if you prefer) as you face the grill. A side to side arrangement would make indirect cooking much easier on the rectangular-shaped grill area, where you could have one burner off and two on, and still have plenty of room for whatever was cooking. Assembling it was a bit of a chore, and took me and two of my buddies about an hour and a half. One note of caution: READ THE INSTUCTIONS CAREFULLY AN PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS!! We didn't, and didn't realize our assembly error until we were a third of the way though the job. No biggie, but this is the second grill I've put together, and they don't get easier. Bottom line: Weber makes the best gas grill of this type in this price range. I expect it to last 10 years with care, and am very glad I bought it"

Roberts,"Englewood, CO","After gilling on an undersized two-burner Char-Broil for ten years, I decided it was time to upgrade to a Weber.  I have used the gril now for a few weeks and it is the best - for direct grilling, perfectly searing steaks, grill roasting, and even slow barbecuing.

If you're looking at this grill, you're probably also considering the other Webers, like the Genesis Silver B.  Go with this one.  For the price difference of about $100, you get the steel Flavorizer bars, a double layer stainless steel hood, a bigger storage area, and dual work surfaces.  A note on the design:  I thought that the LP tank is housed inside the cabinet below the grill - actually it is under the right work surface (not a big deal, but hard to tell from the photos).  The only down-side are the stainless steel cooking grates (extremely durable, but not the best for either conducting or retaining heat), I prefer cast iron for its heat-retention, so I picked up some porcelain-enamaled cast iron grates at a certain big box orange home improvement store before the grill even arrived.

Cooking on this grill is heaven.  We like to barbecue (low and slow, with wood chips in a smoker box), and this grill handled the task wonderfully.  On my old grill, even on low, the wood chips would ignite and turn to ash in about 15 minutes, giving the food a nice sooty flavor.  On this grill, even though it gets very HOT very fast, on medium the wood slowly smoldered just like it is supposed to do.  Great smokey flavor.  We'll be doing our Thanksgiving turkey on it this year!

Sure, this grill is a little pricey, but the quality means you won't have to replace it.  In the long run, a great deal on a high quality product"

Boggs ""another critic""","Memphis, TN","I always have to chuckle when I see the phrase ""atomic clock"". I am sad to report that there is nothing about this clock that is ""atomic"" except the name (well, it's made up of atoms, so I suppose that is worth something). However, it does receive the WWVB radio signals from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO.
On the bright side, if this clock is typical, WWVB receivers have improved over the years. The last ""atomic clock"" I bought before this had some difficulty with reception. This clock does very well. I've owned it about 3 months, and I have placed it in several bedroom locations and gotten the ""strong signal"" indicator in all of them.
The external temperature feature also works well. Some external sensors and receivers I have owned have had difficulty connecting. This one has done perfectly at all locations where I have tried it (my sensor is located in the frame of a bedroom window, and is currently about 15' from the clock).
The clock is, to my mind, easy to use and set. I like that it has battery backup, and I like the ceiling projection (my wife loves that feature, BTW). The projection is bright enough and large enough that even a nearsighted geek (20-200) like me can see it without glasses when I squint. I also like the tasteful level of the alarm. The clock we threw away when this one arrived had all the subtlety of a nuclear power emergency alarm annunciator.
Overall, I like the clock and gave it to my wife after much hinting. It now sits on her side of the bed. She got it last week after saying ""I thought for sure I'd get one of those for Christmas after all the hints I dropped.""
I'd buy it again. In fact, I may end up buying another one."

After a simple assembly process taking about 10 minutes; I fired it up and was amazed how powereful the burner was.  An average home stove's burners produce between 9,000 and 14,000 BTUs -- The big boy produces up to 65,000 BTUs (according to Eastman).  If that doesn't get your wok to turn red hot then nothing short of a jet engine will.

On the subject of woks; I didn't buy one from Eastman and I'm glad I didn't.  I'm sure Eastman woks are top quality but I have a very good reason for my statement.  Lodge makes an iron wok that is not only less expensive but also fits into the Big Kanuna like a key in a lock (with minor modifications to the burner's rack).  The base on the Lodge Pro-Logic 14-Inch Cast-Iron Wok with Loop Handles not only works great on the Big Kahuna but it also sits nicely on your stove thanks to it's flat bottom.

OK, the world isn't perfect so the Lodge wok didn't fit into the Big Kahuna's grill out of the box.  In order to make it fit, I filed down the four cross members of the grill about 1/8"" on each side and now it fits like a glove.  This is a huge advantage over a curved bottom wok because the wok simply can't move and is much safer to use (considering the high temperature of the cooking surfaces this is a big plus).  Let's face it: nobody wants to hold their wok in place while cooking if this can be avoided.

I also recommend that you get an Eastman Stainless Wok spatula (also from Amazon) -- it's almost a requirement.

The only thing I would change on the Big Kahuna would be to add an electronic ignition.  I'll probably add one myself using outdoor grill parts.

Keep in mind that the Big Kahuna, the wok spatula and the Lodge wok are all available from Amazon which means that free Super-Saver shipping is available from Amazon -- resulting in a considerable savings on these heavy items.  You could easily pay twice as much elsewhere."

I ordered this amazing product and the days spent waiting for it were probably the longest of my life.

All the packaging wasn't even necessary, because this bucket folks, hold on to your hats, is made of METAL!  That's right, 100% metal.  As advertised, it is quite capable of holding water, but that moniker is far too restrictive.  This versatile container can hold equal amounts of *any* liquid you can think of.  To test it's claim that it holds two gallons, I went out and bought two gallons of buttermilk from my local dairy vendor.  I poured both gallons of creamy goodness inside the 610, and to my surprise, it held both gallons!  Then, of course, I faced the problem of having to drink two gallons of buttermilk.  Long story short, the 610 was able to handle the resulting two gallons of vomit!  Days later, when I got out of the hospital, cleaning the 610 was no problem.  The galvanized surface made cleanup a snap.  I have found countless other uses for this versatile bucket since then.  Highly recommended"

They flawlessly send their signals to the Oregon Scientific BAR388HGA Weather Station.  I've yet to replace the alkaline batteries in either THGR168.  A third sensor (THGR122N) came with the weather station and is set up outdoors using lithium batteries; it has measured down to -25 degrees F during its first winter.  When I first got the sensors, I set up all of them side by side for a day.  The units measure temperature (C or F) within a tenth of a point and humidity--if the humidity is below 40% or above 70%, they also show 'dry' or 'wet' in the unit window.  A tiny red light flashes each time the signal is sent. I noticed that the temperature readings were fairly close, within a degree or so of each other.  The humidity readings were further apart, as much as 5 percentage points.  With 3 units, one outside, one in an attached garage and the third unit currently in the kitchen, it's a nice benefit to see the temp and humidity directly on the sensor as well as at the base station.  Using the wire stand that comes with the units, they can be easily moved from place to place.  There's also a wall mount for more permanent installation.  Reception has been excellent through as many as four walls and two floors; units are within 40 feet of the base station--I think Oregon Scientific claims reception up to 100 ft.  Only the outside unit's signal occasionally disappears from the command weather station--that signal navigates 4 walls.  Move the command station to a slightly different angle and the info reappears.  In average or better lighting, the read-out is easy to view.  An improvement might be a backlit button to see the LCD readout in dim light.  Being in direct sunlight or shade will affect the readings.  These digital units work well.  I wouldn't claim them to be precise instruments but they are generally accurate; nowhere in the specs does OrgSci make a claim concerning precision"

The foot rest takes a little to get used to, but overall this is a great chair.  I can easily fall asleep in mine"

The table was exceptional also except for the manual labor of constructing it.  One of the drilled holes for the top didn't line up but I have a garage full of tools which helped me correct this problem.  Plan on having someone around to help put this together, it is a little difficult for one person - not impossible, just difficult."

Kay Stone,"Avon Lake, Ohio USA","This is a very nice looking and sturdy table.  A nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch-up paint with the product.

The table may look nice now, but getting there was a pain in the neck.  On the positive side - it is very well packaged.  No worries about any damage during transport - not a small issue for many items.

That said, the instruction sheet included was for a different (rectangular) table with completely different legs.  Even if it was for the same table, it was in that hard-to-understand translated-into-English-using-a-dictionary vocabulary.  There was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers, as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts.  Unfortunately, there were 12 bolts in two sizes and 12 washers - but 16 holes waiting for bolts in the table.  All of the bolts were too long for any of the holes - even with the washers.

I ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store (if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem).  The bolts provided required between 3 and 4 washers each before they could be adequately tightened.

Whew - finally done.  The table is serving us well on the patio.  It replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall.  The open weave design is nice - very easy to clean the top.  Give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and I might give it 5 stars"

Farr ""Johnbbq""","Taos, NM","I love to BBQ!   Hauling a conventional smoker and grill in our RV was both messy and awkward and took up too much room.   The Cobb Grill is the perfect answer for RV owners who are short on space but long for fun and flavor.
In addition it is one of the safest cooking units available and disposal of ash is easy and clean.  For travelers this ease of use and clean up is very important.   In addition you can cook a whole meal at the same time in a Cobb!   It is also one of the least expensive cookers there is out there and all in one small compact unit"

My Dad has also tried it. They had it put up on a tree in less than an hour after they recieved it from UPS. Mom says she can take it down and put it up easily without Dad's help. When a storm hits, this is a good idea. After visiting the folks,  I find that it It fits me(at 6' 2"" and 275 lbs) I can now rate it five stars.  dispite the thin(looking) ropes, this thing could fit a circus elephant it's so strong(Hehe)"

1.  Needs to run completely on A/C power when available.  Right now, the batteries are the primary power source and A/C is used only for the projection light.

2.  The alarm could be a little louder.
3.  There is no way to make the backlight stay on permanently"
