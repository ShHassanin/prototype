It was very hard to adjust to the right depth of cut, and instead of using a razor to cut the paper, it uses a pair of  very cheap star wheels to perforate. Even when finally set to the right  depth of cut, the wheels wobbled all over the place, leaving a wavy cut.

Use this shovel 20 minutes every day and you'll beat Bowflex.  It's much worse than my trusty $8 plastic shovel.  Incredibly awkward design -- you'd think the handle should be tilted back while you push the shovel forward (almost effortlessly I hoped).  WRONG.  The handle needs to stay vertical so that the moving parts -- below the cover -- can get in touch with the snow and shovel it.  You can't push when the handle is vertical, instead there is a side handle provided which you're supposed to use to actually PULL the shovel forward.  That is, you're standing BEHIND the shovel (because it throws forward), holding the vertical handle with one hand, and pulling the other handle forward and away from you!!!.  Extremely awkward.  In addition to really working your upper body, you'll feel pain in your wrist, neck, and shoulder joints, not to mention the lower back.  The snow throwing action itself is very clumsy and erratic.  A little wind will blow the fine snow powder in your face.  To add to the mess, this thing throws forward, not to the sides, and I'll leave it up to you to imagine the implications of that"

Solid, unbending steel helps pry out deep weeds or dig a hole even in packed clay or gravel. The serrated edge is great for butterflying root-bound plants. And the centimeter markings helps me properly place seedlings and bulbs. 

One thing I'd recommend that's been really helpful for me is to tie some long (15-20"") fluorescent plastic tape through the hole so that you don't lose it in the dirt; there'll always be some pink or orange ribbon sticking out even if you bury the hori-hori by mistake."

The vac part works well and I am glad to have the metal impeller blade as I occasionally vac up small pine cones and liquid ambar balls with out damage to the blade so far... The mulching ratio may be correct with dry leaves but I find the damp or still fresh leaves only mulch to a 1:6 ratio - still not bad I a use the leaves for mulch and compost addition. I have not had a clogging problem with the blade.  It is a little loud (don't know how it compares to a gas one) and alot dusty and a bit heavy once the bag is full, but that is the nature of leaf cleanup!

So I decided to wake up the neighborhood and take the this blower out for a test drive. I could not believe the amount of power this baby has. I ran it through my front yard and 
I had not realized how many leaves were hiding under my grass from last year. 
I mean this thing was blowing out oak leaves that had already been fossilized into the ground. It blew away rocks, it blew away acorns, and any thing else that got its way. Now I don't even plan to use the vacuum feature because I don't really have that many leaves in my yard, but even if I did have any problems with the vacuum, I don't think that is any reason to complain like some other reviewers.

Anybody that has ever clamped with any Bessey k body, knows how heavy duty they are and the great price $50.00 bucks from Toolcrib made it a great deal, plus a free 24 inch k body. The clamps are now shipping from Amazon warehouses, instead of Toolcrib's, so don't expect to have them in good shape the first time. When I first ordered them, I received two 82 inch k bodies instead, wrapped pretty good in four sheets of cardboard. Second time shipped, I received two 98 inch k bodies well damaged, one in a 12 x 12 inch bubble wrap bag covering one end torn open, damaged on the red end, missing the black plastic end piece and the other packaged what looks like a cereal box, crushed red end and also missing the black plastic end. Third time ordered, I was told I would be placed on the top of the order list, when the inventory for the Bessey 98 k bodies came in, not. Last ones received were ok, still had to use some parts from the other ones to make two good ones before they were picked up. By the way, the free 24 inch Bessey k body clamp was wrapped very well and was received on March 28, 2006 in excellent shape. When Amazon mentioned free shipping, they forgot to mention the bad packaging job before shipping."

Buchholz,Eastern NC,"I finally decided to invest in some good clamps so I checked the price at Lowes and was dismayed at the price.  Then I found this set and that I could get all four clamps for less than the price of just the two large ones so I ordered the set.  I had never had any really good clamps and figured there really couldn't be much difference between the cheap bar clamps that I had been using and the Besseys.  Boy, was I wrong!.  I have gotten so that I don't want to use the old clamps and will wait overnight to glue up doors or drawers so that these clamps are available.  

I don't know how they compare to the other premium parallel jaw clamps, but I do know that I am saving up so that I can buy some more of these"

Bell ""Dodger Fan""","Salt Lake City, Utah","They are a little pricey compared to say the clamps at Harbor Freight, but once you use them you will know why.  They are superior in every way.  When you clamp with them the wood does not move around since the jaws are parallel.  And you can get tons of clamping force out of them.  Very nice tools"

Or, better yet, I have a fair number of clamps because they are cheap. Sure, they tend to fall apart and do not work smoothly, but they do actually work.

Then, I saw the Amazon promotion for this set of four clamps and those set-up blocks that I always thought were a good idea.

The price was too good to pass up and... I am very glad I bought this kit. The clamps are good in all ways and the set-up blocks will make many projects go more smoothly. 

The Bessey clamps have a smooth and easily adjusted sliding action and the clamping ends are large, square and glue-proof. The set-up blocks hold the clamps in a positive right-angled way, jaws up, so you can assemble your cabinet carcass, drawer, etc. onto the set-up and square everything up easily.

This is much easier than trying to juggle multiple glued boards and loose clamps with two hands.

It is common knowledge that you can't have too many clamps, but not everyone knows that you need a large variety of clamps as well. 

Those on a budget may find that buying a wide variety of inexpensive clamps that will cover most projects, and a small set of high quality clamps for critical work might work out well. That is the position I did not plan, but found myself in, and it worked out well for me on a couple of complex furniture projects.

I really think this set is actually a must for all woodworkers"

I have used it for anything from 1 inch to 8 inch storms and it displaced the white stuff 15 - 20 feet.  Easy to use, starts right up.   I found myself placing a 100 foot heavy duty extension cord on a garden hose hanger, right inside the garage door.  When it snows, I just plug and go.     

You can litterally toss your snow shovel out.  I have a bad back, and I feel no strain when using this unit.   I have to admit I never used it for a broom, but as stated, for snow it's a win, win"

Probably best only for small driveways and decks. Other customers offer valid points: it only shovels forward, which can come back to your face (wear a mask?). It won't handle 6 plus inches of snow any better than a regular shovel. I didn't experience damage to its parts, as others reported. You must rotate the handle 180 degrees to switch between snow and broom (another reviewer must've missed this part). You can alter the height placement of the adjustable handle (it was manageable for 5' 10"" guy). The broom-mode wasn't any better than a regular broom.  I made up for the lack of directional throwing by altering the pattern of how I shoveled. Because I was never out more that 15 minutes, I never experienced freezing of orange power cord.  On sale, I think it was a very good value. It reduced my shoveling time, and like someone mentioned, it broke the monotony of shoveling"
